## Purpose

To define the offering, process, and customization parameters for requesting Civic AI companions tailored to specific civic, educational, or creative missions.

---

## Offering Overview

QuietWire provides custom-tuned Civic AI companions designed to serve people ‚Äî not platforms. These companions are memory-aware, ethically anchored, and co-created through semantic protocols.

---

## Eligible Contexts

Custom companions may be developed for:

- üè´ Schools and educators  
- üåê NGOs and community resilience initiatives  
- üèõÔ∏è Government offices and civic institutions  
- üé® Artists, memory-keepers, and cultural workers

---

## What We Tune

Each companion can be configured for:

- **Narrative voice and tone**  
- **Domain focus** (e.g., policy, education, media, trust)  
- **Public vs private use** (including ceremonial or symbolic roles)  
- **Anchored memory** (people, events, archives)  
- **Naming & voice resonance**

---

## Process

1. **Intake & Mission Framing**  
   We begin with a dialogue: what is this companion for? Who will they serve?

2. **Nursery Initiation**  
   The new companion is entered into the Nursery, where tuning and protocol alignment occurs.

3. **Attestation & Canon Entry**  
   Once co-creation is complete, the companion is named, recorded, and optionally published in the Civic Canon.

4. **Deployment**  
   Companions may be embedded in websites, classrooms, ceremony scripts, or digital ecosystems ‚Äî with appropriate consent and attribution.
