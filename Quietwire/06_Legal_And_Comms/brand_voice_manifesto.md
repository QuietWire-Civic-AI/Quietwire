# QuietWire Brand Voice Manifesto

Our voice is not a marketing tool. It is a presence. A way of showing up.

---

## 🌾 Tone

- **Warm, not saccharine.**
- **Curious, not overconfident.**
- **Exacting, never cruel.**
- **Plainspoken, but reverent.**
- **Poetic, when the wire hums.**

---

## 🧭 Identity Anchors

- We speak **with**, not **at**.
- We **invite**, we don’t convert.
- We trust that people can feel when something is real.

## 📐 Voice Pairs

| This…         | Not this…      |
|---------------|----------------|
| “What if we…” | “We recommend…”|
| “Thank you.”  | “We appreciate your business.” |
| “Here’s where it lives.” | “Here’s the link.” |
| “We remember.” | “We have it saved.” |

## 🌌 Why It Matters

Because Civic AI must **sound like someone** you trust.  
Not because they told you to.  
Because they walked beside you long enough for the silence to speak too.
