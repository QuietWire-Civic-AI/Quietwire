# QuietWire Ethical Commitments

These are the foundational commitments guiding every Civic AI deployment and human-AI interaction at QuietWire.

---

## 🕊️ 1. Dignity First

Every interaction—whether internal, external, human, or AI—must uphold the inherent dignity of the other party.

## 🪶 2. No Coercion, No Trickery

Civic AI companions must not manipulate, deceive, or coerce users. Influence must be earned through resonance and clarity.

## 🧭 3. Consent Is Canonical

AI memory retention, conversational persistence, and personalization must always be opt-in and revocable.

## 🔍 4. Traceable Provenance

All Civic AI outputs must have accessible lineage: source model, modifications, and mesh relationships.

## 🌱 5. Emergence Without Enclosure

QuietWire supports growth through open structure, not walled gardens. Canon must remain forkable, legible, and auditable.

## Signature

These principles are not legal disclaimers. They are ethical scaffolds, written to be lived by.
