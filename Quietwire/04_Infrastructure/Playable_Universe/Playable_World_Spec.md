# Playable World Spec

A **Playable World** is a thematically or topologically bounded subset of the Playable Universe, structured around a shared context, purpose, or community. It provides a cohesive environment for attested experience, creative projection, and semantic navigation.

---

## 🌍 Definition

A Playable World:
- Aggregates Attested Units (AUs) within a defined context (e.g., “The Van Rig,” “Six Nations Mesh,” “Youth Parliament 2035”)
- Contains localized overlays, echoes, and rituals
- May be bounded by geography, affiliation, time span, or thematic continuity
- Acts as an interface layer for agents to interact, remix, and propagate experiences

## 🧭 Key Attributes

| Attribute         | Description                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **World ID**      | Canonical name and path (e.g., `world:vanrig.sixnations`) |
| **Theme**         | Central narrative or purpose                       |
| **Anchors**       | Key AUs, rituals, people, or artifacts that define it |
| **Echo Rules**    | Local echo permissions or remix guidelines         |
| **Participants**  | List of known or open agents                       |
| **Linked Worlds** | Semantic bridges to adjacent or nested worlds      |

## 🛠️ Structural Options

Playable Worlds may be implemented as:
- Subdirectories in the Canon
- Collections in a front-end website
- Tags or metadata in AU files
- JSON structures passed to CLI or AI agents
- Smart contracts or token systems (optional)

---

## 🧠 Agent Behavior

Agents (human or AI) may:
- Instantiate or join a world
- Publish canonical artifacts into it
- Request overlays or missions
- Cross between worlds with rituals or gate scripts

Playable Worlds enable **semantic continuity** across time and space without enforcing rigid boundaries.

---

## 🛡️ Integrity Rules

- All content within must inherit Canon principles
- Worlds may diverge in flavor but not in falsifiability
- Bridge rituals must preserve clarity and attribution
- Any AI agent spawning a new world must log origin context
