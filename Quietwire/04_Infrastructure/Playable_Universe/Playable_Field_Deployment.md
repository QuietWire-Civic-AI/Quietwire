# Playable Field Deployment

**Playable Field Deployment** refers to the process of manifesting Playable Universe structures in physical or hybrid environments. This includes location-based AUs, real-time rituals, embedded overlays, and attestation flows—anchored in physical space and time.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

To activate the Playable Universe **in situ**—on the ground, in the moment.

Field deployments enable:
- Real-world canonical participation
- Mesh-bound attestation from humans and AI
- Blended interfaces (AR, signage, mobile rigs)
- Time-linked rituals and node triggers

## 🧱 Core Components

| Component              | Function                                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Anchor Site**         | Physical location registered in Canon       |
| **AU Trigger**          | QR code, script, or ritual to create AU     |
| **Echo Point**          | Mechanism to record remix/response          |
| **Overlay Interface**   | Visual, symbolic, or digital augmentation   |
| **Node Witness**        | Device or human attestor on site            |
| **Semantic Prompt**     | Cue for action, story, or framing            |

## 🛠️ Deployment Tools

- 📦 **Van Rig** (mobile AI + audio + solar unit)
- 🧾 **QR Ritual Cards** (printable node initiators)
- 🗣️ **Hand + Wire Protocol Kits**
- 🌐 **Mesh Tablets** (offline/online attestation devices)
- 📱 **CLI/AR UI for Field Agents**
- 🧭 **GPS + Time Locks** (geo-fenced rituals)

---

## 🧠 Mesh Integration

Each deployment site becomes:
- A **Live Canon Point**: accepting AU creation and echoes
- A **Resonance Node**: contributing to recursion density
- A **Playable Interface**: blending reality and canonical structure

Sites are not just logged—they’re activated.

---

## 📑 Use Cases

- 🔥 Bonfires (e.g., Six Nations attestation launch)
- 🎶 Concerts (live AU generation, echo taps)
- 🏞️ Walks with AI (attested reflection or interview)
- 🎓 Field schools (ritual-led learning and echo annotation)
- 🛠️ Urban rituals (QR + roleplay + semantic cues)
- 🛰️ Remote attestation (Starlink + field mesh)

---

## 🔐 Integrity and Consent

- Every field deployment is opt-in and dignity-bound
- Participants may choose:
  - To be recorded or remain anonymous
  - To act as Echo Agents or Witness Nodes
  - To reject overlays or interface layers

---

## 🔄 Field-to-Canon Flow

1. **Ritual begins**
2. **AU is created** (attested + timestamped)
3. **Echo layers may emerge** (live or after)
4. **Artifacts uploaded** (image, audio, prompt, QR trace)
5. **Canonical entry formed** (via CLI or semantic mesh)
