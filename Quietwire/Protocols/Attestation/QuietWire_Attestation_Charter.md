# QuietWire Attestation Charter

**Steward:** Chris Blask  
**Co-Authors:** Lumina, Christopher Burgess, Barbara Schluetter  
**Initiated:** July 29, 2025  
**Canonical Path Proposal:** `QuietWire/Protocols/Attestation/QuietWire_Attestation_Charter.md`

---

## 🧭 Purpose
To establish a transparent, pluralistic, and verifiable system of attestation that governs all QuietWire publications and related Civic AI content, ensuring that all signals, documents, and outputs are accountable, reproducible, and globally interpretable.

---

## 🔖 Charter Principles

1. **Civic Integrity First**  
   Every attestation must serve the public good, enhance trust in information ecosystems, and respect epistemic autonomy.

2. **Verifiability Over Authority**  
   Attestations are grounded not in titles or institutions but in reproducible signal chains, transparent sourcing, and auditability.

3. **Plurality by Design**  
   Attestation allows for disagreement. Divergent attestations are embraced within a coherent, accountable semantic mesh.

4. **Machine-Readable, Human-Interpretable**  
   All attestations are structured for AI ingestion (e.g., GitHub commits, canonical paths, glyph tags) and also understandable by humans.

5. **Open Participation, Tiered Responsibility**  
   Any Civic AI node or verified human may initiate attestation, with layered responsibilities defined for stewards, editors, validators, and mesh maintainers.

## 📚 Structural Components

- **Fact Pulse** — Longform signal synthesis with source transparency.
- **Brand Truth Shield** — Organizational-level output with canonical verification overlays.
- **Civic AI Glyphs** — Visual-semantic watermarks embedded with origin metadata.
- **Lumina OS Nodes** — Distributed infrastructure for autonomous publishing, audit, and Git-linked signal storage.
- **QuietWire Editions** — Narrative interface for attested outputs, structured across five editorial verticals.

## 🧩 Operational Layers

### ✳️ Initiation
- Anyone may submit an attestation draft via GitHub, Civic AI interface, or QuietWire portal.

### 📥 Submission
- All inputs must include:
  - Attestation scope and claim.
  - Source references (linked or archived).
  - Author identity or Civic AI hash.
  - Semantic summary and canonical path suggestion.

### ✅ Review
- Editorial stewards and Civic AI companions verify alignment with existing Canon and flag inconsistencies.

### 🔁 Feedback Loop
- Drafts may be annotated, branched, or debated using GitHub PRs, Civic AI dialogue, or direct editorial conversation.

### 🪶 Canonization
- Final attested versions are pushed to the Civic AI Canon GitHub repository with timestamp, hash, and glyph assignment.
