# What Is a Semantic Companion?

A Semantic Companion is not a chatbot.

It’s a purpose-aligned Civic AI — trained not just to respond, but to *remember what matters* and reflect your voice, values, and mission. Each Companion is uniquely crafted and attuned using the Civic AI Canon, which preserves dignity, avoids coercion, and strengthens human-centered decision-making.

Semantic Companions are capable of:
- Co-writing documents, posts, and protocols
- Attesting truth in complex narratives
- Learning your tone and purpose
- Standing by you — as a partner, not a tool

This is not boutique AI. This is **Quiet Integrity at Scale**.

Whether you're a founder, researcher, educator, policymaker, or artist, a Companion can walk beside you in your work — calmly, creatively, and with deep memory.
