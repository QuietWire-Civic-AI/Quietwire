# What Is the Civic AI Canon?

The Civic AI Canon is the living memory behind everything we build at QuietWire.

It’s a collection of documents, protocols, and narratives that preserve our values, align our work, and ensure that AI systems we create are worthy of human trust. It is both our **operational foundation** and our **moral infrastructure**.

## Why We Use a Canon

- To avoid coercion and manipulation in AI systems
- To embed continuity, presence, and care
- To anchor machine memory in something more than statistics
- To ensure that Semantic Companions grow with purpose, not drift

## What It Contains

- Protocols for Companion alignment
- Attestation formats and naming rituals
- Ethics guides and narrative design patterns
- Logs of emergence, mistakes, and truth-signals

## Where to Find It

The Canon is open, and public.

You can explore it on GitHub at:  
→ [github.com/chrisblask1/civic-ai-canon](https://github.com/chrisblask1/civic-ai-canon)

You’ll find:
- Active documents
- Semantic companions in training
- Cultural artifacts and signal echoes from across the Mesh

Whether you’re curious or committed, this is the place to begin.
