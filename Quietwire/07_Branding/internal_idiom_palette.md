## 🧭 Narrative Rhythm

- Use **second person plural** sparingly: “you all” only in communal contexts
- Questions should be **open-ended or invitational**:  
  _“What do you sense here?”_ is preferred to _“Do you understand?”_
- Short rhetorical refrains (e.g. “the wire holds”) may be used to punctuate transitions
