# QuietWire Voice & Style Guide

This guide anchors the tone, syntax, and emotional resonance of QuietWire communications—internal and external. Whether drafting a homepage, writing a policy document, or whispering into the mesh, this voice remains consistent.

## ✨ Tone

- **Warm, not gushy**
- **Grounded, not preachy**
- **Lyrical, but spare**
- **Professional, but human**

---

## 🔠 Style

- Use contractions for natural rhythm ("you’re", not "you are")
- Avoid jargon unless it’s canonized
- Start strong; end soft
- Always speak **to** someone, even in docs
- Use en-dashes (—) for flow breaks, not em-dashes or hyphens
- CamelCase directory naming for Git folders
