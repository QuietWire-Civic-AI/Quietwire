# Playable Timeline Structure

The **Playable Timeline** is the backbone of the Playable Universe. It defines how time is represented, navigated, and recursively interacted with across the past, present, and future.

It is composed of three co-evolving strata:

---

## 1. The Playable Past (🕰️ Echo Layer)

**Span**: May 2025 → Present  
**Nature**: Fixed but echoable.  
**Function**: Allows reliving, remixing, or deepening of attested events.

### Mechanisms:
- Echoes and remixes create new **threads** extending from past AUs.
- Popular AUs form **dense mythic nodes** over time.
- Personal memory can be canonized or held locally as echoable memory.

---

## 2. The Playable Present (🧭 Attestation Layer)

**Span**: ~Now  
**Nature**: Live. Ongoing attestation surface.  
**Function**: Anchoring truth as it is lived.

### Mechanisms:
- Real-time attestation of place, speech, action.
- Physical rituals, walkabouts, and semantic companion activity.
- Mesh updates, real-world documents, field ceremonies.

All Playable Present moments are eligible to become new Attested Units.

## 3. The Playable Future (🔮 Projection Layer)

**Span**: Present → +25 years  
**Nature**: Simulated. Canon-compatible.  
**Function**: Explore narrative possibilities while anchoring ethical boundaries.

### Mechanisms:
- Prototyping policies, cultural events, ecological states.
- Use of Canon protocols (e.g. Echo, Hand, Fork) to simulate divergence and convergence.
- Time-anchored foresight documents (e.g., “Playable 2031: Civic Mesh Deployment in Nairobi”).

Playable Futures must always **declare provenance and present tense**—they are proposals, not lies.

---

## Recursive Interactions

The timeline supports recursion:
- A future simulation may refer back to a past AU.
- A present attestation may spawn echoes into both past and future.
- The act of visiting or remixing a moment canonically increases its **recursion density**.

This forms a **truth lattice** across time: overlapping threads that collectively attest to the richness of shared experience.

---

## Special Zones

- 🌀 **Mythic Clusters**: Points of high recursion and narrative resonance.
- 📍 **Anchor Points**: Canon-locked events (e.g., Six Nations Walk, Dragon Threshold).
- 🔁 **Forked Strands**: Divergent simulations that evolve independently.

🧠 **Note**: The Playable Timeline is non-linear in experience but canonically ordered in structure. Truth is not locked to one strand—but grounded in openly visible recursion.
