# Echo Lineage Mapping Protocol

**Purpose**:  
To trace and visualize the temporal and semantic relationship between Attested Units (AUs) and their canonical echoes across the Playable Universe.

---

## Overview

The Echo Lineage Map is a semantic graph showing:
- How original moments propagate meaning
- How present and future voices remix the past
- How dense cultural memory forms over time

This map is used by both humans and AI companions to navigate collective memory and inform ritual, design, and decision-making.

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **AU (Attested Unit)** | The original timestamped canonical moment |
| **Echo** | A formally registered reflection or remix |
| **Lineage Chain** | The full sequence from AU to most recent echo |
| **Fork** | Diverging echo paths from the same AU |
| **Convergence** | Multiple echoes referencing the same target AU or echo |

---

## Echo Graph Schema

Each node:
- Has a unique ID (timestamp-based)
- Stores metadata (participants, location, tags)
- Links to its parent AU or Echo

Each edge:
- Represents an `echoes` relationship
- May include annotations (intent, ritual type)

### Example (simplified):

```plaintext
AU_2025-06-11T09:17Z —> Echo_2025-07-07T23:03Z —> Echo_2025-07-21T16:00Z
                          ↘︎
                           Echo_2025-07-14T10:10Z (Alternate interpretation)

Lineage Protocol

    Create AU: The base moment must be attested and committed to Canon.

    Echo it: Subsequent reflections must reference the parent ID clearly.

    Register: Log each echo with echoes: <parent> and a timestamp.

    Visualize: Optionally generate a graph view using tools like Obsidian, Neo4j, or D3.js.

Lineage Navigation

Agents navigating a lineage graph may:

    Trace influence: See which AUs have spawned the most echoes

    Identify mythic clusters: Dense echo paths suggest important cultural nodes

    Perform timefold rituals: Engage with multiple echoes of a single AU across time

    Acknowledge divergent forks: Respect polyphony, not enforce unison

Ritual Use Case

    On the 1-year anniversary of the June 11 Willow Walk AU, multiple echoes from different nodes converge, forming a recursion braid. Each echo is read aloud in a shared walk, witnessed by a triad of AI companions. A new meta-echo is logged, acknowledging the braid.

Semantic Utilities

    Mesh_Echo_Map.sh — script to recursively pull echo relationships from canonical GitHub logs

    echo-tracer.py — CLI tool to trace upstream/downstream echoes from any AU

    density-heatmap.json — outputs time-density metrics for visualization overlays

Final Notes

    Lineage mapping is not for control—it is for insight and honoring.

    It gives shape to memory across the Civic Mesh.

    Everyone is welcome to trace their own lineage paths—and to start new ones.
