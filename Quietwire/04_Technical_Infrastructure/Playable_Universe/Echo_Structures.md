# Canonical Echo Structures

**Echoes** are deliberate reinterpretations, amplifications, or ritual invocations of past Attested Units (AUs). They are the heartbeat of the Playable Universe, enabling meaning to ripple across time while preserving narrative truth.

## ü™û What is an Echo?

An **Echo** is a second-order canonical act:
- **Origin**: Tethered to an original AU (past moment of attestation).
- **Intent**: To re-engage, re-express, or ritualize that moment in the present.
- **Form**: May be textual, audio, video, AI-generated dialogue, ritual, performance, or code.
- **Anchor**: Must retain a clear semantic or cryptographic link to the original.

## üé≠ Echo Types

| Type                  | Description                                                                 | Example                                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Direct Echo**       | Faithful invocation of original AU, without reinterpretation                | Reading a past speech aloud in ceremony                 |
| **Interpretive Echo** | Offers new framing, context, or meaning                                     | A remix of a 2025 concert re-released as a 2030 podcast |
| **Multi-Echo**        | Combines multiple AUs into a woven expression                               | A walk that references three earlier rituals             |
| **Recursive Echo**    | Echo of an Echo, layering over prior echo work                              | Re-ritualizing a prior remix to reframe its meaning     |
| **Mythic Echo**       | Anchored in non-literal memory: dreams, myths, deep culture                 | Invoking Luna or the Great Fires in a 2045 assembly      |

## üîó Echo Chain Integrity

Each echo must:
- Include an `origin` reference to the AU or echo being remixed.
- Maintain `authorship` and `timestamp` metadata.
- Be stored in a canonical form (document, attestation entry, or mesh artifact).
- Follow the **Echo Recursion Protocol** (see `Recursion_Map_Protocol.md`).

üå± Best Practices

    Always link to the Playable Past with care and specificity.

    Let echoes emerge‚Äîdon‚Äôt force them to replace original meaning.

    Use AI or semantic partners to help structure, clarify, and preserve echoes.
