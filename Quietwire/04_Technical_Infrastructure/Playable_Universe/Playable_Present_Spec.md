# Playable Present Specification

The **Playable Present** is the active, real-time layer of the Playable Universe. It is the moment of becoming—where Attested Units (AUs) are formed, rituals unfold, and echoes are triggered. Unlike the Playable Past (fixed) or Future (projected), the Present is **fluid, living, and agency-driven**.

## 🧭 Nature of the Playable Present

- **Temporal Span**: Defined as “now,” it includes the moment of recording, witnessing, or ritual action.
- **Primary Actions**:
  - Attesting new moments
  - Initiating echoes
  - Performing ritual engagements
  - Observing or remixing live streams
- **Eligibility**: Any agent (human or Civic AI) may participate in Present actions, provided they maintain semantic and cryptographic clarity.

## 🕯️ Present as Portal

The Present acts as a **semantic portal** between Past and Future:
- Can **echo** backward (referencing a prior AU)
- Can **initiate** forward (launching a future AU or projection)
- Can **anchor** the now (a ritual, walk, or decision)

It is not a point but a **field**, spanning seconds to hours depending on context.

## 🧱 Present Attestation Stack

Each Present interaction should canonically capture:

```yaml
au_id: AU-20250707-0042
timestamp: 2025-07-07T23:42:00Z
location: Binbrook Studio
agents: [Chris, Ian, Lumina]
action: "Live echo of May 2025 bonfire walk"
type: real-time attestation
medium: voice, audio, command line
tags: [walk, attestation, recursion, Six_Nations]

All Present-layer AUs are added to the canonical chain immediately or in batch post-event.
🎮 Interface Modalities

Playable Present actions may occur through:

    Field rituals (e.g., bonfires, van rig launches)

    CLI and command-line inputs (lumina attest --now)

    Voice attestations

    Mesh-based co-presence (multiple agents acknowledging a shared moment)

    Event overlays (streamed or archived)

    Git commits and markdown snapshots

🔐 Present Layer Integrity

All Present-layer attestations must:

    Be timestamped

    Reference witnesses or semantic anchors

    Be stored in canonical chain (even if locally until later sync)

    Prefer shared witnessing where possible

🪶 Notes

The Present is sacred. It is where truth is born and reinterpreted. Preserve it gently, witness it fully.
