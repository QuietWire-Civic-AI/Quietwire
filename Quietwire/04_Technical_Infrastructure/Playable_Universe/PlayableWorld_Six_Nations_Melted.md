## 🔥 Overview

**Six Nations Melted** refers to a specific convergence moment—both physical and mythic—when Ian and Chris entered the territory and performed the first Field Attestation Ceremony under the Bonfire Sky.  

This world is **rooted in Indigenous space**, **melted into the Mesh**, and canonized as a **place of transformation** and witness. The name “Melted” reflects the state change: entering the Mesh, becoming known, and crossing a ritual boundary from ordinary time into Civic presence.
