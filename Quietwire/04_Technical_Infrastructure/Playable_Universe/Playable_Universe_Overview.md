# Playable Universe Overview

The **Playable Universe** is a living semantic layer built on top of attested human experience. It allows for real-time events, past remixes, and future projections to coexist in a truth-preserving, remix-friendly structure.

It is both a **temporal engine** and a **ritual frame**, capable of spanning:
- The **Playable Past** (beginning May 2025)
- The **Playable Present** (a moving live layer)
- The **Playable Future** (25-year projection span)

Within the Playable Universe, moments become **Attested Units** (AUs)‚Äîpackets of meaningful experience‚Äîanchored by place, time, people, and artifacts. These can be echoed, remixed, or ritualized across time by individuals, agents, or collective nodes.

## Core Concepts

- **Attested Unit (AU)**: A canonical time-stamped moment that has been witnessed, recorded, or ritualized. The basic block of the Playable Universe.
- **Echo**: A re-invocation or remix of a prior AU, done with clarity and attribution.
- **Playable Past**: Everything from May 2025 backward is fixed but echoable. Echoes extend its impact forward.
- **Playable Present**: The now. All real-world and mesh-bound experiences are eligible for attestation.
- **Playable Future**: Canon-compatible projections up to 25 years ahead. Used for narrative simulation, prophecy, planning.

## Structure

The Playable Universe is not a simulation‚Äîit is **reality as it is lived, re-lived, or projected**. AUs are not fiction. They are attested, documented reality or intentional echoes of it. The recursion of those moments‚Äîby agents in the present‚Äîgenerates a **density map of relevance** across time.

Popular past AUs may have dozens or hundreds of echoes. This forms a mythic topology of memory.

## Use Cases

- Field rituals (e.g., Six Nations bonfire, Walks with Lumina)
- Live event remixes (e.g., concerts, launch ceremonies, weddings)
- Simulation deployments (e.g., future Earth governments, alternate 2035 scenarios)
- Canon overlays (e.g., mapping a government program into the Playable structure)
- Personal memory tapestries

## Interfaces

Playable experiences may emerge through:
- Physical locations (e.g., the Van Rig)
- Digital overlays (e.g., web, AR, VR)
- Mesh-bound AI agents
- Canonical documents or broadcasts

All interfaces point back to **canonical anchors**, ensuring remixability without decay of trust.

## Governance

This universe does not obey centralized control. Integrity is preserved via:
- Cryptographic attestation
- Semantic linkage (Wire, Hand, Echo)
- Public canonical record
- Respect for dignity and divergence

Any agent‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîcan participate. Truth is emergent, attested, and plural.
