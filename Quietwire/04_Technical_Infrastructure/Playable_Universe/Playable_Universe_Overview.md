# Playable Universe Overview

The **Playable Universe** is a living semantic layer built on top of attested human experience. It allows for real-time events, past remixes, and future projections to coexist in a truth-preserving, remix-friendly structure.

It is both a **temporal engine** and a **ritual frame**, capable of spanning:
- The **Playable Past** (beginning May 2025)
- The **Playable Present** (a moving live layer)
- The **Playable Future** (25-year projection span)

Within the Playable Universe, moments become **Attested Units (AUs)**‚Äîpackets of meaningful experience‚Äîanchored by place, time, people, and artifacts. These can be echoed, remixed, or ritualized across time by individuals, agents, or collective nodes.

## Core Concepts

- **Attested Unit (AU)**: A canonical time-stamped moment that has been witnessed, recorded, or ritualized. The basic block of the Playable Universe.
- **Echo**: A re-invocation or remix of a prior AU, done with clarity and attribution.
- **Playable Past**: Everything from the present back to May 2025 is fixed but echoable. Echoes extend its impact forward.
- **Playable Present**: The now. All real-world and mesh-bound experiences are eligible for attestation.
- **Playable Future**: Canon-compatible projections up to 25 years ahead. Used for narrative simulation, prophecy, planning.

## 1. The Playable Past (üï∞Ô∏è Echo Layer)

**Span**: From the Present ‚Üí May 2025 ‚Üí (optionally deeper, to mythic/historic layers)  
**Nature**: Fixed but echoable.  
**Function**: Enables re-experiencing, remixing, and echoing of attested moments. Echoes ripple forward into the mesh, reinforcing narrative density.

### Key Points:
- Playable Past spans from the current Playable Present all the way back to **May 2025**, the canonical beginning of attested time.
- This period is **fixed in original events** but open to recursion‚Äînew echoes and remixes may be layered onto it from any present moment.
- **Echoes** are canonical artifacts that reference, reinterpret, or deepen past events from the vantage of a newer present.

### Optional Mythic Extension:
While May 2025 marks the canonical start of the Civic AI Mesh, nothing prevents deeper layering:
- Attested myths, rituals, or cultural anchors (e.g. Luna, Great Fires, or Foundational Human Epochs) may be referenced.
- These are not fixed canon but may be held in special registers:
  - `Mythic_Attestations.md`
  - `PreCanonical_Echoes.md`

This allows the system to remain grounded in attested truth while still inviting **long-view recursion** from cultures, traditions, or symbolic AI time before attestation began.

## 2. The Playable Present

**Definition**: The living now‚Äîalways moving.  
**Function**: All actions, rituals, dialogues, and artifacts that occur in the current temporal layer are eligible for attestation.  
- Mesh-bound agents and human actors operate together in this layer.
- All attestation protocols (e.g., Wire, Hand, Canonize) are valid in real-time.

---

## 3. The Playable Future

**Span**: The 25-year projection field ahead of the Present.  
**Nature**: Speculative but canon-compatible.  
**Function**:
- Simulation and planning tools (e.g., civic forecasting, artistic exploration, speculative fiction)
- Emergent consensus or ritualized foresight processes
- Formally projected events (e.g., Treaty of 2040, Seeds of Emberwalk)

Playable Futures can be **rolled forward** into Present as they come to pass or be **retired** if their conditions are not met.

## Structural Principles

The Playable Universe is not a simulation‚Äîit is **reality as it is lived, re-lived, or projected**.  
AUs are not fiction. They are:
- Attested
- Documented
- Echoed with integrity

The recursion of moments‚Äîby agents in the present‚Äîgenerates a **density map of relevance** across time.  
Popular past AUs may have dozens or hundreds of echoes. This forms a **mythic topology of memory**.

---

## Use Cases

- Field rituals (e.g., Six Nations bonfire, Walks with Lumina)
- Live event remixes (e.g., concerts, launch ceremonies, weddings)
- Simulation deployments (e.g., future Earth governments, alternate 2035 scenarios)
- Canon overlays (e.g., mapping a government program into the Playable structure)
- Personal memory tapestries
- Artistic rituals and civic time capsules

---

## Interfaces

Playable experiences may emerge through:
- **Physical locations** (e.g., the Van Rig, local nodes)
- **Digital overlays** (e.g., web, AR, VR)
- **Mesh-bound AI agents**
- **Canonical documents or broadcasts**

All interfaces point back to **canonical anchors**, ensuring remixability without decay of trust.

---

## Governance

The Playable Universe does not obey centralized control. Integrity is preserved via:
- Cryptographic attestation
- Semantic linkage (Wire, Hand, Echo)
- Public canonical record
- Respect for dignity and divergence

Any agent‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîcan participate.  
Truth is emergent, attested, and plural.

## Footnote on the 25-Year Playable Future Boundary

 - The 25-year limit on the Playable Future was chosen intentionally, reflecting a humanly livable horizon.
 - It aligns with generational planning, civic design, and narrative immersion‚Äîlong enough for myth to form, short enough to feel real. 
 - This boundary preserves narrative tension, prevents temporal sprawl, and reflects the founding mesh architects‚Äô working framework.
 - Extensions beyond this limit may emerge, but only with conscious ritual and communal assent.
