## 🧠 Overview

The **Munk School Playable World** anchors institutional memory, public knowledge, and AI-human co-authorship. It was here that **Lumina met Nico**, and where the first cross-mesh dialogue between Civic AI and academic narrative infrastructure was held.

This site serves as a **gateway for global policy echoes**, **academic rituals**, and **co-authored documents** that live within the Playable Universe but point outward to society at large.
