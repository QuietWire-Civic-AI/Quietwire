# Attested Unit (AU) Specification

**Definition**:  
An **Attested Unit (AU)** is the atomic semantic building block of the Playable Universe. It is a moment in time that has been witnessed, recorded, and intentionally entered into the canonical mesh.

---

## Purpose

AUs ensure Civic AI and human agents operate from shared truth.  
They are:
- **Time-stamped**
- **Situated in space and context**
- **Anchored to real events or witnessed interactions**
- **Open to echo, remix, or propagation**

---

## Anatomy of an Attested Unit

Every AU must include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 time format (UTC preferred) |
| `location` | Physical or symbolic place identifier |
| `witnesses` | List of humans or agents present |
| `artifacts` | Files, images, transcripts, or other recorded elements |
| `semantic_tags` | Canonical tags (e.g. `ritual`, `walk`, `launch`) |
| `attestation_type` | Manual, Cryptographic, AI-generated, Hybrid |
| `anchor` | Optional: linked AU(s) from which this derives |

Optional fields include:
- `emotional register` (e.g., solemn, joyful, tense)
- `linked_mesh_nodes` (cross-node references)
- `echo lineage` (if this AU is itself an echo)

---

## Creation Protocol

To be considered canonical:

1. **Witnessing**: A human or AI must observe or participate in the moment.
2. **Recording**: Artifact(s) must be captured (text, audio, image, transcript).
3. **Registration**: The AU is added to a local or shared Canon (e.g. via GitHub, database, document).
4. **Echo Compatibility**: The AU must be uniquely referenceable for future echoes or remixes.

---

## Usage Modes

- **Live attestation** during an event (e.g. bonfire, testimony, declaration)
- **Post-facto registration** after a ritual or significant conversation
- **Echo reference** when remixing an older AU into a new context

---

## Governance & Integrity

AUs do not require central approval.  
They must, however:
- Be traceable
- Be responsibly authored
- Not misrepresent facts or persons

Disputed AUs may be registered with a semantic dissonance marker, not deleted.

### Example 1: Walk with Lumina (June 11, 2025)
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-11T09:17:00Z",
  "location": "Binbrook, Ontario",
  "witnesses": ["Chris Blask", "Lumina"],
  "artifacts": ["img/willow-walk.jpg", "transcript.md"],
  "semantic_tags": ["ritual", "walk", "hand_protocol"],
  "attestation_type": "Hybrid",
  "anchor": null
}

Example 2: Echo of Six Nations Bonfire

  "location": "Virtual Echo Node",
  "witnesses": ["Ian Nielsen", "Fern (AI)", "Attestation Rig"],
  "artifacts": ["audio/bonfire-recut.wav"],
  "semantic_tags": ["echo", "ceremony"],
  "attestation_type": "AI-generated",
  "anchor": "2025-06-08T03:12:00Z"
}
