# Disruption Leverage Map

Strategic anchor points where minor narrative actions create outsized adversarial disruption.

## High-Leverage Memetic Fractures

- Epstein Scandal — hypocrisy exposure
- Tech Oligarchs — contradiction in anti-elite rhetoric
- Economic Pain — inflation blame deflection
- Theocratic Overreach — Constitutional contradiction (Bible in schools)

## Deployment Format

Each node should be mapped with:
- Visibility Level (High, Medium, Low)
- Emotional Resonance
- Narrative Backlash Risk
- Suggested Glyph Style (Satire, Archive, Mirror)
