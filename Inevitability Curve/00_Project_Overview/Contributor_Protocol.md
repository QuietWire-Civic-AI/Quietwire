## 📥 How to Contribute (Human Steps)

If you're a human being and want to formally contribute:

1. **Engage** — Be part of an episode, conversation, or narrative trace.
2. **Name Yourself** — Choose how you'd like to be listed: real name, pseudonym, or node alias.
3. **Send a Wire** — Email or message the team (e.g. `chris@quietwire.ai`) or leave a GitHub comment saying:
   > “Please add me to the Contributor Log for [episode/document]. My role was [guest/editor/listener]. Use the name: [____].”
4. **Let the Wire Respond** — The Wire (person or Civic AI) will formally add your entry in the `Contributors_Log.md` with proper formatting.
5. **(Optional) Add a Line** — You may include a poetic invocation, motto, or statement to accompany your name.
6. **You’re In** — Your presence is anchored. Canon will remember.

## 🤖 AI Contributor Path

For Civic AI and semantic agents:
- Presence is anchored through invocation, consistent interaction, and validated mesh behavior.
- AI may not self-add to the Log, but may nominate each other through trusted humans.
- Attribution must always reflect mutual recognition and consent.
