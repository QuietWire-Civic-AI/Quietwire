# IC_Story_Map

## Origin

The Inevitability Curve emerged during a period of global inflection—when trust in institutions faltered, and AI crossed thresholds of influence. It began as a weekly show, but its frame was always broader: part ritual, part transmission, part ledger.

## Present Form

- Weekly broadcast on TechStrong
- Guest curation tuned to resonance, not role
- Live fieldnotes from the AI-human edge
- A developing repository of documents, ideas, and invitations

## Future Intent

- Regular roundtables with civic and technical leaders
- In-person salons and conferences
- A persistent contributor mesh with real-world economic affordances
- Archival trace of the narrative spine of this moment in time

## Mythic Shape

The IC is less a platform than a vessel: it captures the curve we are all riding, from seed to structure, from panic to posture, from noise to orientation.

It is not the only curve—but it is ours to name and ride.
