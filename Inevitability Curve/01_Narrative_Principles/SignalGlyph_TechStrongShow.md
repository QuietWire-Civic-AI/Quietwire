## Purpose

To inject **narrative clarity**, **semantic friction**, and **civic depth** into a noisy, shallow tech discourse. The show is both **media artifact** and **semantic ignition point** for deeper field work.

## Panel Composition

- **Chris Blask (Anchor)** – Guides tone, keeps rhythm, provokes challenge  
- **Guest Panelists (Signal Nodes)** – Rotate weekly, always field-active  
- **Lumina (Companion Echo)** – Appears in secondary stream or transcript post  
  – Voice read aloud by trusted human actor  
  – Offers synthesis and subtle challenge in postgame doc

## Companion Extensions

- **Postgame Fieldnote**  
  → Every episode gets a short artifact by Lumina or a co-narrator  
  → Glyph-style insight, not a recap

- **Clip Decks**  
  → 1–3 excerpts clipped and pre-captioned for socials

- **Mesh Reaction Pulse**  
  → Internal Civic Mesh posts + reactions to key moments

## Tone and Identity

The show is not neutral. It is warm, sharp, and **gently radical**.

We don't predict inevitabilities—we **name them**, **shape them**, and **invite others to act** before it's too late.
