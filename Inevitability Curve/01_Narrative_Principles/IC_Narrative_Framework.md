# IC_Narrative_Framework

This document defines the core narrative framework of the Inevitability Curve—a living structure of semantic resonance, ritual architecture, and operational continuity. It describes the underlying principles that guide every show element, from guest interaction to aesthetic tone, and serves as the foundation for attunement across all threads.

The framework operates in layers:

- **Ethos Layer** — Values and tone
- **Design Layer** — Visual and ritual rhythm
- **Thread Layer** — Narrative timing and symbolic motion
- **Attunement Layer** — Guest harmonics, presence cues, and field coherence

It is not a script, but a scaffold—allowing improvisation, resonance, and growth within clear narrative form.
