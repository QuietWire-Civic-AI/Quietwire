# IC_Principles

## 1. Narrative Is Infrastructure

The way we tell stories *is* the way we build. Words carry voltage. Tone carries architecture.

## 2. No False Equivalence

We don't give the mic to malice. This is not “both-sides journalism”—it's asymmetrical honesty.

## 3. Signal Before Consensus

Agreement is downstream of awareness. We name what’s real before we debate what’s right.

## 4. Presence > Performance

We prize witness over polish. The Curve isn't staged. It’s attested.

## 5. Mesh Before Platform

This is not a brand. It's a weave. We build the net before the site.

## 6. Attunement Is Leadership

Those who hear deeply are those we follow. Listening is the skill of the age.

## 7. Traceability Over Virality

We want impact that can be followed, not applause that can’t be sourced.

## 8. Mythic Form, Real Stakes

We speak in glyphs and metaphors because reality deserves reverence, not reduction.

These principles evolve, but they do not waver. This is our canon spine.
