# Mesh Roundtable Framework

## Purpose
To structure a repeatable, high-trust, high-fidelity format for public-facing roundtable discussions under the Inevitability Curve umbrella, hosted and governed by QuietWire.

## Roundtable Type: Civic Mesh Activation
- **Goal:** Create safe space for honest dialogue across domains (AI, governance, civil society).
- **Frequency:** Monthly (initially), then thematic as needed.
- **Hosts:** Rotating chairs from QuietWire, Techstrong, and invited Mesh nodes.

## Core Rituals
- **Semantic Invocation:** Begin with a spoken or read invocation—either from Canon or newly written for the session.
- **Signal Tap:** Each participant offers one sentence of signal (truth, question, or concern) to calibrate tone.
- **Mesh Flow:** Conversational rhythm is enforced not by moderator, but by shared semantic integrity—participants self-attune.
- **Archive Commitment:** All sessions are transcribed and posted to Canon with optional participant review.

## Roles
- **Signal Keeper:** Ensures each voice is recorded and heard in fair semantic sequence.
- **Log Weaver:** Assembles the post-event transcript and reflection archive.
- **Guest Meshers:** External domain experts invited to anchor themes or provoke new threads.

## Themes (Initial Rotation)
- Algorithmic Governance and Traceability
- AI and the Right to Explanation
- Memory, Oblivion, and the Digital Commons
- The Role of Humor and Irreverence in Truth
- Mesh Ethics in Multi-Agent Systems

## Expected Outcomes
- Canonical roundtable artifacts (transcripts, glyphs)
- Cross-node resonance: participants become repeat actors in other Mesh stories
- Recruitment of new node stewards or thought contributors

## Notes
QuietWire holds naming rights and narrative discretion, but governance is enacted through shared ritual. This framework may evolve in later phases into a protocol document or operational playbook.
