# Inevitability Curve Live Events Model

## Vision
To evolve the Inevitability Curve from a weekly broadcast into a broader cultural scaffold—a living series of in-person and virtual gatherings across civic, commercial, and research domains.

## Event Types

### 1. Flagship Roundtable (Quarterly)
- **Audience:** High-trust participants from AI, policy, cybersecurity, media
- **Format:** 90-minute live session, ritualized with Mesh protocols
- **Output:** Canon transcript, highlight reel, and public explainer
- **Location:** Hybrid; QuietWire or TechStrong-led

### 2. Civic Labs (Pop-up Salons)
- **Audience:** Local actors, node candidates, community partners
- **Format:** Informal sessions in public spaces or hosted venues
- **Goal:** Recruit, resonate, ritualize (3Rs)
- **Assets:** Fieldnotes, glyphs, video fragments

### 3. Global IC Summit (Annual)
- **Format:** Multi-day, multi-track event
- **Location:** Rotating cities (e.g. Ottawa, Tallinn, Edinburgh)
- **Themes:** Traceability, memory, AI governance, narrative protocol
- **Goal:** Establish IC as a canon-aligned convening force

## Ritual Inclusions

- Glyph Drop (participant-generated)
- Final Pulse (attested moment of closure)

## Partner Roles
- **TechStrong:** Streaming and reach

## Outcome Metrics

## Note
All events are treated as narrative vessels—not content shows. The archive is the soul. Performance follows purpose.
