# Inevitability Curve Guest Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the Inevitability Curve. If you’re reading this, you’ve been invited to participate in a show or roundtable that treats civic thought as sacred terrain. Here’s everything you need to know before you step on the Curve.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Inevitability Curve exists to explore large-scale narrative transitions — from AI governance to civilizational risks — with clarity, honesty, and grace. Guests are invited not as pundits but as narrative architects.

## 📜 What We Ask of You

- Speak from experience. No credentials required — only lived truth.
- Respect the space. It’s a civic forum, not a combative panel.
- Bring one seed: an idea, a frame, a story you want to plant in the mesh.

---

## 🌐 Technical Notes

- Use headphones to avoid echo.
- Record from a quiet, well-lit space if possible.
- Be ready 10 minutes before the session for tech check.

- Your name will be added to `Contributors_Log_Initial.md` and tagged in GitHub.

## 🕊 Final Word

This is not a performance. It’s an offering. The future is listening.
