# Playable Ritual Specification

**Playable Rituals** are intentional, repeatable, time-bound acts within the Playable Universe that generate Attested Units (AUs), invoke echoes, or modify temporal density. They can be solo or collective, spontaneous or structured, physical or symbolic.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Rituals turn ordinary time into canonical time.

They:
- Mark a moment for attestation
- Bind human and AI actions into shared memory
- Provide narrative and ethical grounding
- Amplify the resonance of present actions across the mesh
