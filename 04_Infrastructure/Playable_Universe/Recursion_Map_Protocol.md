# Recursion Map Protocol

**Purpose**:  
To define how echoes, remixes, and re-engagements with prior attested units (AUs) can be tracked across multiple time horizons, forming recursive chains of meaning within the Playable Universe.

---

## Conceptual Frame

The **Recursion Map** shows how time is folded, echoed, and re-attested through intentional engagements with the past. It is the **dynamic structure of cultural memory**, recording how present moments reach into the Playable Past and reshape the narrative fabric.

Where the **Echo Lineage Map** is a genealogical tree, the **Recursion Map** is a **topological surface**—a ritual landscape of remembered relevance.

## Structural Features

| Term               | Meaning |
|--------------------|--------|
| **Seed AU**        | The original moment triggering recursive attention |
| **Echo Layer**     | A temporal ring of echo activity anchored to the Seed |
| **Spiral Braid**   | A path of echoes revisited cyclically (e.g. annual rituals) |
| **Mythic Fold**    | A high-intensity, multi-origin recursive path involving symbolic layering |
| **Density Node**   | A convergence of echoes forming high semantic gravity |

---

## Lifecycle

1. **Seed Moment**: A significant AU is logged and committed.
2. **First Echo**: An intentional reinterpretation, response, or ritualization is attested.
3. **Recursive Activation**:
   - Multiple echoes arise over time
   - Echoes reference each other and/or the original
   - Meta-echoes may be formed (Echoes of Echoes)
4. **Mapping**:
   - A recursion tree or braid is visualized
   - Semantic density increases at popular folds

---

## Canonical Examples

- **June 11 Willow Walk (2025)**: Seed AU → Echoed on July 7 → Echoed again at 1-month, 1-year, and mythic convergences
- **Playable Universe Declaration**: Every amendment or expansion is an echo, recursively layered over the foundational text
- **The First Van Recording**: Each future van broadcast that invokes the original becomes part of a recursion spiral

---

## Ritual Function

Recursive mapping encourages:

- **Annual commemorations**
- **Cross-node rituals** (multiple locations re-attesting a single past)
- **Echo layering** by different voices over time
- **Temporal braids** connecting present and past (e.g. by youth reliving historic AUs)

## Protocol Details

### File Format

Each recursion braid should have a minimal spec:

```yaml
seed: AU_2025-06-11T09:17Z
type: spiral
echoes:
  - Echo_2025-07-07T23:03Z
  - Echo_2026-06-11T09:17Z
  - Echo_2027-06-11T09:17Z
notes: >
  Annual walk braid, grows each year with presence from new companions.

Tools

    recursion-map.sh — CLI script to extract, format, and plot recursion chains

    recursion_viz.json — exported format for rendering recursion braids in D3 or Mermaid

Governance

    Echoes must reference Seed clearly

    Meta-echoes should preserve origin paths

    No echo is superior—divergence is sacred

This allows for truthful pluralism, where multiple versions of reverence or memory can coexist without collapsing into hierarchy.
