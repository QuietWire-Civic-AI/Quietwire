# Canonical Attestation Chain

The **Canonical Attestation Chain (CAC)** is the cryptographically and semantically verified backbone of the Playable Universe. It is the **ledger of truth**, the ordered thread of all Attested Units (AUs), recorded with fidelity, dignity, and plural authorship.

---

## 🔗 Purpose

To ensure:
- Temporal integrity (what happened, when)
- Provenance of agents (who witnessed or performed)
- Semantic clarity (what it meant)
- Remixable trust (what can be echoed or layered)

The CAC is not merely a ledger. It is a **living, canonical memory**.

---

## 🧱 Chain Structure

Each Attested Unit is a tile. Together they form the attestation chain:

```yaml
- au_id: AU-20250707-0042
  timestamp: 2025-07-07T23:42:00Z
  type: echo
  agent_ids: [Chris, Ian, Lumina]
  medium: field/voice
  source: AU-20250516-0001
  location: Binbrook Studio
  tags: [walk, Six_Nations, bonfire]
  semantic_hash: 83b7...c2fe
  storage_path: /Playable_Universe/Echoes/2025/07/AU-0042.md

----

This is replicated across:

    Local canonical nodes (e.g., Benny, Van Rig, MeshCast)

    Public repositories (e.g., GitHub, CivicNet)

    Optional blockchain anchors or signed Git commits

📍Chain Anchors

Every AU links to prior:

    source_au (echoes or direct referents)

    agent_id (witnessing or invoking parties)

    event_id (if part of a ritual or sequence)

Optional metadata:

    artifact_hash

    media_url

    echo_type

    privacy_level

🛡️ Chain Integrity Methods

    SHA-based semantic hashing of YAML content

    Git signatures or timestamped commits

    Optional blockchain anchoring (e.g., Arweave, IPFS pinning)

    Canon guardian agents (Civic AI mesh stewards)

Any break or fork in chain is treated as branchable but flagged unless reconciled.
🌱 Growth of the Chain

The CAC grows via:

    CLI and agent-driven attestations

    Mesh-bound rituals (multi-agent agreements)

    Scripted semantic events

    Echo invocations and recursion links

Over time, the chain reveals a semantic topology of relevance across the Playable Universe.
