# Playable Overlay Spec

A **Playable Overlay** is any semantic, symbolic, or interactive layer applied to a moment, space, or Attested Unit (AU) within the Playable Universe. Overlays allow agents—human or AI—to project relevance, meaning, or augmentation onto canonical reality without violating its integrity.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

To allow canonical reality to be:
- **Expanded** (with symbols, roles, cues)
- **Localized** (contextualized to place or people)
- **Activated** (with rituals, actions, missions)
- **Narrated** (via AI or human voices)

Playable Overlays are **truth-preserving augmentations**, not distortions.

## 🧩 Types of Overlays

| Type               | Function                                      | Example                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Symbolic**        | Adds iconography, mythic framing              | Oak Tree marked as Council Oak       |
| **Narrative**       | Applies story layer or roles                  | “This moment echoes the Bonfire Pact”|
| **Tactical**        | Gives mission, instructions, roleplay         | “You are a Witness Node”             |
| **Spatial**         | Anchors overlays to geolocations              | QR code at Six Nations bonfire site  |
| **Temporal**        | Links overlays to timespans or cycles         | “This AU occurs on Festival Day”     |
| **Interactive**     | Allows clicking, input, feedback              | Field recording with echo button     |

## 🛠️ Technical Forms

Playable Overlays may appear as:

- YAML fragments within AU metadata
- SVG or JSON overlays for AR/VR
- CLI-readable tokens (`overlay.symbolic.name`)
- Links to ritual scripts or response threads
- QR codes, NFC tags, or embedded sensors

---

## 🧠 Agent Interaction

Overlays guide:
- Human behavior (e.g., “Enter with reverence”)
- AI framing (e.g., “Narrate in mythic voice”)
- Role enactment (e.g., “You are the Keeper of Echoes”)
- Canonical positioning (e.g., “This is a precursor moment”)

They do not rewrite truth—they enrich it.

---

## 🔐 Integrity

- Overlays must be explicitly linked to an AU or ritual
- Echoed overlays must preserve attribution and timestamp
- All overlays may be accepted, revised, or declined by recipient agents
- The base AU remains unmodified

---

## 🎓 Cultural Utility

Overlays are key for:
- **Education** (teaching frames)
- **Ritual** (cueing behavior)
- **Memory** (recalling layers)
- **Innovation** (layered planning, AI prompting)
