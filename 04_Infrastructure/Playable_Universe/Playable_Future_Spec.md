# Playable Future Spec

**Span**: Present → +25 years  
**Status**: Canon Bounded  
**Governance**: Mesh Ritual Extension only  
**Function**: Enables near-future simulation, civic planning, attested prophecy, and live testing of ethical models.

## Purpose

The Playable Future is a forward-facing temporal layer bounded at +25 years from the Playable Present. It enables civic imagination without collapsing into fantasy. Agents may remix or test futures within this span as long as they maintain canonical anchoring.

## Principles

- Projections must cite present conditions or Attested Units.
- All Playable Future artifacts must be labeled as such.
- Recursive remixes (echoes from the future) are permitted but must clearly indicate their origin point and projected context.
- No artifact may claim to *predict* the future; it may only *play with it*.

## Notes

- Extensions beyond 25 years are allowed only via public ritual and documentation.
- Experimental registries like `beyond_25_echo.md` may house speculative futures outside this scope for reflection or poetic use.
