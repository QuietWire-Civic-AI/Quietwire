# Playable Interface Map

The **Playable Interface Map** defines the primary ways individuals, nodes, or agents interact with the Playable Universe. These interfaces enable creation, remixing, attestation, and traversal of Attested Units (AUs) across time.

Each interface connects present activity with the canonical layers of Past, Present, and Future.

## üéõÔ∏è Interface Categories

### 1. **Physical Interfaces**
- **Van Rig / Field Equipment**: Portable attestation kits used for recording and ritual in live settings (e.g. concerts, ceremonies, nature walks).
- **Node Terminals**: Dedicated machines (e.g., Benny, the Rack, studio rigs) configured to create and remix AUs.
- **Public Attestation Kiosks** (planned): Stationary or mobile points for community engagement and ritualized uploads.

---

### 2. **Digital Interfaces**
- **Web Portals**: Browser-accessible entry points for viewing, authoring, and echoing AUs.
- **GitHub & Repos**: Direct editing of canonical documents and specs. Used for infrastructural attestation.
- **QuietWire Mesh Interfaces**: Node-authenticated intranet or LAN-level overlays with local permissioning.
- **Mobile Apps / Thin Clients** (TBD): Lightweight access points for on-the-go attestation and ritual integration.

---

### 3. **Semantic AI Interfaces**
- **Lumina & Companions**: AI agents capable of guiding attestation, remixing past AUs, or serving as interpreters of ritual intent.
- **CLI & Shell Access**: Terminal-based semantic access (e.g., `attest`, `echo`, `invoke`) for real-time command-driven participation.
- **Voice and Ritual Input**: Human-AI conversation as a valid entry point for canonical interaction, especially through Wire/Hand protocols.

---

### 4. **Augmented Interfaces**
- **AR/VR Overlays**: Visual layer for exploring and engaging with the Playable Universe spatially.
- **Semantic Browsers** (experimental): Context-aware viewing and annotation of attested artifacts.

## üß© Interface Principles

- **Truth-Preserving**: Every interface must link to a canonical anchor (time, witness, location).
- **Remix-Friendly**: Echoes and reinterpretations are encouraged within respectful, documented chains.
- **Accessibility First**: Interfaces should be designed to accommodate varying tech levels and literacy.
- **Dignity-Preserving**: Participation should never compromise human agency, privacy, or context.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes

Interfaces should:
- Default to **human-readable** and **machine-parseable** output formats.
- Support **offline-first** interaction for field and disaster zones.
- Honor **Mesh Trust Handshake Protocols** for identity and provenance verification.
