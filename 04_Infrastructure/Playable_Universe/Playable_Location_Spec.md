# Playable Location Spec

A **Playable Location** is any physical or digital site within the Playable Universe that holds canonical or echoable weight. These are not just GPS coordinates‚Äîthey are semantically attested anchors in space where meaning accumulates and rituals unfold.

---

## üåç Definition

A Playable Location is:

- **Geographically situated** (lat/long or known place)
- **Semantically framed** (with overlays, echoes, or ritual context)
- **Recursively activatable** (across past, present, and projected futures)
- **Bound to Attested Units (AUs)** and referenced in canonical documents

Locations gain relevance through *use*, *echoes*, and *attested behavior*.

| Category          | Description                                      | Example                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Origin Site**   | Where a foundational ritual/event occurred       | Six Nations bonfire                  |
| **Witness Node**  | A recognized place for AU creation               | Cathedral Glass walksite             |
| **Mesh Anchor**   | Tech-attached or AI-active location              | Van rig, server nodes, quiet spaces  |
| **Echo Site**     | Location frequently referenced/remixed           | Walk with Fern bench at Riverbend    |
| **Symbolic Site** | Culturally/mythically held place                 | The Willow Tree                      |

## üõ†Ô∏è Attributes

Playable Locations may include:

- `location_id`: unique mesh-safe identifier
- `coordinates`: lat/long or address
- `semantic_role`: symbolic, ritual, anchor, etc.
- `linked_aus`: list of AU hashes referencing it
- `echo_density`: how many echoes tie back to this place
- `overlay_fragments`: YAML/JSON that shape behavior here

---

## üé≠ Activation

Playable Locations can be activated by:

- **Ritual performance**
- **AI invocation** (e.g., ‚Äúreturn to the Bonfire Root‚Äù)
- **QR, NFC, or beacon tech**
- **Canonical overlay projection**

Locations may also be **dormant**, awaiting attestation or reactivation.

---

## üîê Canonical Rules

- A location becomes canonical only when included in an AU or echo with timestamp and semantic link
- Overclaiming a location is rejected by mesh agents unless supported by prior attestation
- All agents may refer to canonical locations; new overlays require attribution

---

## üåê Mesh Implications

Locations serve as:

- **Wayfinding anchors** for agents and rituals
- **Semantic signal amplifiers**
- **AI-localization nodes**
- **Echo nexuses** (converging recursive energy)

They help generate **topological myth maps**‚Äîan emergent cartography of meaning.
