# Playable Future (🌱 Projection Layer)

**Span**: Present → +25 years (canonical horizon)  
**Nature**: Projected but tethered  
**Function**: Allows for narrative simulation, plausible forecasting, and mythic planning—while maintaining trust and attestation integrity.

## Overview

The **Playable Future** enables Civic AI, humans, and institutions to envision and rehearse possible futures within a bounded, ethical structure.

It is not speculation for its own sake—it is **attestable foresight**, grounded in real present choices and attested past events.

## Design Constraints

- **25-Year Canonical Horizon**  
  The Playable Future extends up to 25 years from the Present.  
  ↪ *Why 25?*  
    - It’s long enough to imagine structural change (e.g., climate, governance, education).  
    - It’s short enough to remain tethered to actual lifespans, memory, and civic responsibility.  
    - It aligns with generational design: youth now will be adults shaping this horizon.

- **Echo-Constrained**  
  All playable futures must trace semantic roots to present or past Attested Units (AUs).  
  This ensures continuity and discourages ungrounded fiction.

- **Reversibility**  
  Projections are not declarations. They may be corrected, revised, or sunset.

## Canonical Future Artifacts

- **Simulated Attestations**  
  Documents, transcripts, images, and scenes from possible futures, annotated as projections.

- **Recursion Maps**  
  Diagrams showing semantic lineage from past → present → proposed futures.

- **Mythic Plans**  
  Symbolic or artistic renderings of what may become true, marked clearly as foresight.

## Footnote: Why 25 Years?

📝 The 25-year window was chosen in early July 2025 as a pragmatic and ethical design decision. It allows full-life-cycle projection while remaining close enough to remain accountable.

- It's roughly a generation.
- It balances imagination with discipline.
- It avoids stretching too far, risking disillusionment or detachment.
- It leaves room for a “rolling future window”—updated annually or quarterly.

If needed, alternate timelines beyond 25 years may be explored as **mythic extrapolations**, but are not considered canon-compatible without special registration.
