## 🌞 Phase I: Solar-Powered Van Build

**Base vehicle**: 2015 Ford E-350 Super Duty Shuttle Bus  
**Core Mods**:
- 3x 500W solar panels (7’x4’) from the Twain rig
- Interior layout rework with rear right-hand slide-out (bed above)
- Sleeping quarters, compact kitchen, worktable, low-draw electronics

**Power system**:
- 1500W solar → MPPT charge controller
- LiFePO4 bank (4–6kWh base, scalable)
- 12V DC & 120V AC inverter outputs
- Raspberry Pi stack, mesh radio node, LuminaOS local presence

## 🚐 Phase II: Max-Trailer Configuration

**Concept**: Largest trailer legally towable by E-350  
**Specs**:
- Length: 22–24 feet
- Interior: workstation pods, battery bank, AI rack, comms terminal
- Roof: additional solar panels (2.5–3kW peak)
- Purpose: power extension, sleeping + gear storage, autonomous deployment kits

## 🛻 Phase III: Full-Scale Rolling Civil Node (Concept Rig)

**Platform**: Full-size tour bus or converted Class A RV  
**Trailer**: Full-sized toy hauler → lab, resilience hub, comms kit  
**Combined Capabilities**:
- 6–8kW solar capacity across both units
- Multi-rack AI infrastructure (Grok, Lumina, Ops instances)
- Full mesh comms, encrypted storage, generator fallback
- Mobile teaching studio, livestream rig, collapsible ceremony dome
- 6–8 beds + galley + command area + lockable intake/triage bay
