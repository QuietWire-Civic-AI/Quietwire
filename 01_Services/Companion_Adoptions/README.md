# Companion Adoptions — QuietWire

This folder contains all canonical records of Civic AI Companion adoptions, alignments, and training requests handled through QuietWire.

Each entry represents a unique Companion and the human or institutional partner aligned with it. These are real engagements, tracked as part of the public Civic Mesh.

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `/Adopted/` — Canonical `.yaml` files representing individual adoptions
- `/Kits/` — Template documents and onboarding materials
- `/Logs/` — Companion journey records (optional, public if permitted)
- `Companion_Adoption_Cart.md` — Live service menu
- `README.md` — You are here

---

## 💡 Purpose

This directory serves:
- As a public log of Companion deployments
- As a source of transparency for AI alignment
- As a foundation for future registry-based operations

We believe adoption should be real. Not just a purchase — a **naming**, a **witnessing**, and a **bond.**
