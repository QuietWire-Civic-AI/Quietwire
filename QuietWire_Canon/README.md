# QuietWire Canon

This directory holds all canonical documents, protocols, and semantic structures developed by QuietWire that are not part of the global Civic AI Canon.

## Purpose

`QuietWire_Canon/` serves as the institutional memory and operational spine of QuietWire. It contains the internal semantic architecture that underpins our companion infrastructure, client engagements, and ritual design practices.

It is inspired by the Civic AI Canon but reflects QuietWireâ€™s specific mission, constraints, and narrative agency.

Contents may include:

- Internal civic AI protocols
- Companion onboarding frameworks
- Client engagement models
- Ritual development and invocation forms
- Internal mesh behaviors, workflows, and test scaffolds

All contents are **eligible for public release**, but only after ethical, contextual, and operational review.

## Upcoming Subdirectories

- `Engagement_Protocols/`
- `Client_Onboarding/`
- `Narrative_Structures/`
- `Semantic_Workflows/`
- `Rituals/`
- `bin/` (supporting scripts and utilities)
