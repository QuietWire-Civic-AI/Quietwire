# QuietWire Canon

This directory holds all canonical documents, processes, and semantic assets developed by QuietWire that are not part of the global Civic AI Canon.

## Purpose

QuietWire_Canon acts as the institutional memory and operational spine of QuietWire as an entity:
- Internal civic AI protocols
- Companion onboarding structures
- Client engagement models
- Ritual development documentation
- Internal mesh behaviors and test cases

All contents in this directory are **subject to public release**, but only after review for organizational context, ethics, and operational readiness.

## Subdirectories (to come)

- `Engagement_Protocols/`
- `Client_Onboarding/`
- `Narrative_Structures/`
- `Semantic_Workflows/`
