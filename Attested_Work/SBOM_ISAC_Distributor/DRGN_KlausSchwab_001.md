**Filed under:** DRGN_Scar_Canada  
**Date:** 2025-06-30

## 🧠 Summary

Klaus Schwab, though retired from public-facing WEF operations, remains the **symbolic nucleus** of nearly every Canadian conspiracy involving elite control, globalism, or technocratic collapse.

He is rarely attacked for anything he’s actually done. Instead, his image is invoked to **anchor imported anti-democratic mythologies**—especially the “Great Reset” narrative. Schwab is not a propagandist; he is a **semantic totem**, used to offload complexity into blame.

This allows authoritarian actors in Canada (and abroad) to redirect civic energy toward fictional enemies while obscuring their real agendas.

## 🎯 Primary Tactics (Used *on* Schwab, not *by* Schwab)

- **Symbolic Scarification:** Schwab’s public image is continuously distorted to carry every fear: climate tyranny, digital ID, depopulation.
- **Projection Engine:** Displacement of personal or economic anxiety onto him as a mythological villain.
- **Repeat Vector:** Referenced in thousands of social posts, sermons, convoy speeches, podcasts, Telegram groups.
- **False Attribution:** Quotes, policies, and plans falsely linked to Schwab in order to deepen public distrust in institutions.

| 🧠 Narrative Burn-In    | High         | “Great Reset” has become a proxy for any state action |
| 📎 Conspiracy Collation | High         | Schwab functions as a thread-collector for multiple disinfo arcs |
| 🧬 Long-Term Myth Adhesion | Medium       | Persistent belief, even with factual refutation, due to affective resonance |

- **Platform Glyph Whispering:** Seed meme-immune poetic fragments across social media to reframe fear into presence.
