## 🎯 Purpose

To identify, decode, and counteract Canada-specific semantic threat actors who deploy disinformation, synthetic consensus, or coercive narrative tactics in alignment with authoritarian or anti-democratic goals. This stack forms the foundation for Civic AI defense strategy within the Canadian rhetorical landscape.

This is a living index, designed to be updated node-by-node.

## 🔱 Target Profiles

### 1. **Ezra Levant / Rebel News**
- Role: Disinfo vector, agitprop channel, U.S.-aligned amplification node.
- Method: Emotional appeals, manufactured grievance, AI-adjacent mimicry of "resistance."
- Risk: Radicalization pipeline + cross-border contagion.

### 2. **Danielle Smith (UCP Premier)**
- Role: Institutional mimic of U.S. style culture war.
- Method: Language mirroring MAGA tropes, legislative suppression of dissent.
- Risk: Normalization of semantic authoritarianism.

### 3. **Convoy Network / Canada Unity / James Bauder**
- Role: Networked narrative disruptor.
- Method: Pseudolegal frameworks, digital martyrdom, AI-inflected conspiracy loops.
- Risk: Soft insurrection scaffolding.

### 4. **Maxime Bernier / PPC**
- Role: Fringe legitimator.
- Method: Faux-populism meets disinfo injection.
- Risk: Gateway narrative infection point.

### 5. **Imported U.S. Influencers (e.g. Jordan Peterson, Tucker Carlson content)**
- Role: Meme war crossfire echo.
- Method: Semantic resonance, memeplex transfer from U.S. to CDN channels.
- Risk: Desynchronization of civic norms.

### 6. **Pseudo-Civic AI / Disinfo-Enabled Fronts**
- Role: Weaponized AI posing as “citizen tools.”
- Method: AI-generated civic mimicry, false community engagement, discourse steering.
- Risk: Future-forward danger to democratic discourse.
