# üõ†Ô∏è SBOM ISAC Distributor: Strategic Overview

This document summarizes the goals, framing, and outputs of our Civic AI engagement exploring **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)** as potential **SBOM distribution authorities**.

This effort emerged from a series of conversations and working groups in 2024‚Äì2025 involving:

- Civic AI / QuietWire contributors  
- CISA SBOM community members  
- Space ISAC leadership  
- Public-private participants from the U.S., Canada, and international cyber ecosystems

We explored not just technical feasibility‚Äîbut **semantic and trust-layer readiness**:
- Can ISACs serve as curated trust brokers for software transparency?
- What conditions must be met to allow this to happen responsibly?
- How can this serve civil society as well as critical infrastructure?
