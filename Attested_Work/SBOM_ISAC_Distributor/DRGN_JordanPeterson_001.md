## ðŸ§  Summary

Dr. Jordan Peterson functions as a **semantic fracture engine** within Canadian (and global) discourse. Once known for academic rigor and psychological insight, his rhetorical trajectory has transformed him into a **myth-binding amplifier** for cultural grievance and existential polarization.

He does not manufacture disinformation directly but enables it through **symbolic absolutism**, **emotional overcoding**, and the repeated use of mythic binaries (Order vs. Chaos, Masculine vs. Feminine, Victim vs. Tyrant).

Within the Civic Mesh, he represents a key conduit through which vulnerable individuals are drawn from confused civics into memetic radicalization pipelines.

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Tactics

* **Myth Compression:** Reduces complex sociopolitical phenomena into digestible moral binaries.
* **Grievance Alchemy:** Transforms personal dissatisfaction into moral outrage and collective identity.
* **Semantic Drift Amplification:** Embeds rhetorical uncertainty into conversations about gender, identity, and truth.
* **Authority Cloaking:** Uses academic credentials to give epistemic weight to affectively charged positions.
