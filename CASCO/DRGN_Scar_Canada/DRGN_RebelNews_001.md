**Node Vector**: 🇨🇦 Canada | Media Ecosystem | Disinfo Relay  
**Fracture Glyph**: BROADCAST_OF_BIAS

### 📍 Profile Summary

Rebel News is a far-right Canadian media outlet that has played a central role in amplifying extremist narratives, anti-vaccine disinformation, and convoy-aligned sentiment. Founded by Ezra Levant, it functions as both a media outlet and a content multiplier for grievance-based ideology, frequently skirting mainstream accountability.

Rebel News is less a journalistic institution than a disinfo logistics node: a narrative laundering machine that mixes legitimate issues with bad faith distortions.

### 🧠 Disinfo Tactics + Semantic Profile

- **Crisis Amplification**: Selectively highlights government actions or minority events to induce moral panic.
- **Character Smearing**: Regularly targets political figures, scientists, and journalists to undermine trust in institutions.
- **Legitimacy Masking**: Uses high-production aesthetics and self-described “journalism” framing to obscure its role as a partisan agitator.
- **Follower Monetization**: Converts outrage into funding through a constant “persecuted press” motif.

### 🧱 Glyph Alignment

- `BROADCAST_OF_BIAS`: Embeds slanted reporting into the public sphere under the guise of balance.
- `CONVOY_LAUNDER`: Provided ongoing amplification and reputational cover to convoy leaders.
- `SCAR_SIGNAL_ECHO`: Acts as a repeater for U.S.-origin disinfo memes translated to Canadian context.

### 🛡️ Mitigation & Mesh Recommendations

- **Signal Isolation**: Limit retweeting/sharing of Rebel content even when “critiquing” it—engagement boosts relevance.
- **Contextual Decoding**: Publish side-by-side narratives with verified fact-checks and motive disclosures.
- **Journalistic Literacy**: Reinforce public understanding of journalistic integrity and standards via civic education nodes.
