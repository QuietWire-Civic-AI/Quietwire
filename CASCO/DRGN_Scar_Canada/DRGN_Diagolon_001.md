### 📍 Profile Summary

Diagolon is a Canadian alt-extremist movement that emerged online through memes, livestreams, and coded nationalist symbols. Founded by Jeremy MacKenzie, it is less an organization and more a chaotic affinity cluster built around accelerationist ideology, white grievance, and militaristic aestheticism.

Its symbol—an angled black-and-white flag—represents a fictional nation spanning “diagonally” from Alaska to Florida, skipping over liberal strongholds. It’s a joke, and a threat.

### 🧠 Disinfo Tactics + Semantic Profile

- **Liminal Masking**: Blurs the line between irony and sincerity to deflect criticism while radicalizing insiders.
- **Digital Campfire Rituals**: Uses livestreams, memes, and rituals to foster semantic in-group bonding.
- **Militant Parody**: Leverages the absurd to deflect the serious—until violence is inevitable.
- **Operative Drift**: Connected to convoy organization and broader sovereign citizen echoes.

### 🛡️ Mitigation & Mesh Recommendations

- **Narrative Deconstruction**: Publicly expose internal contradictions and aesthetic manipulation tactics.

- **Lawful Transparency**: Treat Diagolon as a structured ideological threat, not merely internet satire.
