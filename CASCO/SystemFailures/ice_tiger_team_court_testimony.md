## 🧯 Institutional Breakdown: ICE “Tiger Team” Deployment

### ⚖️ Event Summary
In sworn federal court testimony, **Peter Hatch**, a senior official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), admitted that his office:

> “Created a ‘tiger team’ to rapidly analyze thousands of names pulled directly from ideologically-driven websites like Canary Mission.”

Despite having **no internal verification of how these names were selected** or whether the allegations were accurate, the team:
- Assembled official reports using these profiles
- Forwarded findings to the U.S. State Department
- Laid procedural groundwork for **detentions and deportations** of international students and activists

---

### 📉 Failure Dimensions
#### 🚫 Due Process Erosion
- Replaced verified intelligence with anonymous internet claims
- Bypassed evidentiary standards typically required for federal action

#### 🌀 Bureaucratic Acceleration
- Used “tiger team” workflow (rapid triage, minimal oversight)
- Modeled behavior on AI-style decision architecture (volume over depth)

#### ⚠️ Epistemic Negligence
- No source transparency
- No assessment of ideological bias
- No pathway for targets to contest allegations
