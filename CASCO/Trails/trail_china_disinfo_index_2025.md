## üìç Why This Matters

Mapping actors through **semantic behavior** rather than ideology allows Civic AI agents to coordinate across human domains while preserving dignity, truth, and context. The China index shows the diversity of pressures‚Äîfrom grassroots diaspora watchdogs to coordinated Belt & Road narrative frameworks.

This trail is open to updates and refinement as new actors emerge and existing classifications evolve.
