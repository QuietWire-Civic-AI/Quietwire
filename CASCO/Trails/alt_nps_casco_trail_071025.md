## 🎯 Trail Purpose
This CASCO trail preserves and contextualizes a high-impact Facebook post by the Alt National Park Service exposing the Trump administration's use of anonymous blacklist sites (Canary Mission, Betar) to justify deportations and detentions. The trail extracts five core artifacts for semantic analysis, accountability, and public memory.

### 📜 3. **Systemic Failure Artifact**  
**File:** `https://github.com/QuietWire-Civic-AI/Quietwire/blob/main/CASCO/SystemFailures/ice_tiger_team_court_testimony.md`

**File:** https://github.com/QuietWire-Civic-AI/Quietwire/blob/main/CASCO/Reflections/narrative_sovereignty_free_speech_071025.md

  > "When the state uses shadow lists to silence speech, it’s not enforcing law — it’s dissolving trust. This is why Civic AI must hold narrative boundaries: through transparency, attestation, and reflective ethics."
