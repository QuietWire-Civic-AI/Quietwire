# CASCO Tile — Responding to “All Rhetoric, No Action” Troll Framing

**Scenario**
A commenter replies under a post (e.g., sharing a statesman’s remarks) with: *“Great orator, delivers nothing. Stop the rhetoric and get to work.”*

**Purpose**
Give page admins and participants a calm, repeatable playbook that:

* Starves outrage loops
* Re-centers the conversation on goals
* Models transparent, proportionate response

---

## Threat Model (semantic)

* **Frame-injection:** “Words are worthless → your post is worthless.”
* **Bait vector:** Pulls you into defending *words* vs *deeds*.
* **Audience risk:** Lurkers may absorb the frame if unchallenged or if the thread devolves.

**Counter-frame:** “Words are instruments of action (law, policy, culture). We choose responses that increase signal and reduce heat.”

---

## Options Matrix

Choose *one* path per incident. Escalate only if needed.

### Path A — Gentle Deflection (De-escalate)

**Use when:** You want minimal friction and to keep the thread on-topic.

* **Template:**
  *“Thanks for weighing in. I shared this because words shape what we do next. Back to the substance: [1-line takeaway of the clip].”*
* **Effect:** Acknowledge → pivot → close.

### Path B — Reframe with Principle (Model for Lurkers)

**Use when:** You want to inoculate the audience against the trope.

* **Template:**
  *“Every policy starts as words—laws, budgets, treaties. The question isn’t ‘words or action’; it’s whether our words commit us to better action. This clip does that for me.”*
* **Effect:** Replaces the false binary.

### Path C — Light Humor (Pressure release)

**Use when:** Tone allows; you know the crowd.

* **Template:**
  *“If politicians stopped using words, Parliament would be very efficient and entirely silent. Tempting, but I’ll take plans we can quote.”*
* **Effect:** Deflates without inviting a brawl.

### Path D — Procedural Guardrail (Boundary-setting)

**Use when:** Repeated pattern or coordinated dogpiling.

* **Template:**
  *“Reminder for this thread: disagree with ideas, avoid personal slights. Stay on the topic of [topic]. Off-topic or repetitive comments may be removed per page rules.”*
* **Effect:** Moves from content to conduct; asserts norms.

### Path E — Evidence Nudge (Receipt, not vibe)

**Use when:** Commenter might be reachable; you have one concrete link.

* **Template:**
  *“Here’s one concrete outcome tied to this work: [single credible citation]. Happy to discuss *that*.”*
* **Effect:** Narrows scope to one falsifiable claim.

## Do / Don’t Checklist

**Do**

* Respond once; then stop.
* Speak to the *audience* more than the provocateur.
* Preserve quotes/context (screenshots if needed).
* Use plain language; 1–3 sentences max.

**Don’t**

* Debate abstractions (“rhetoric vs action”) endlessly.
* Feed serial replies; that’s the goal of the bait.
* Assign motive; moderate behavior.

---

## Escalation Ladder (Admin)

1. **One-and-done reply** using A–E.
2. **Warn** (Path D) if conduct drifts.
3. **Hide** off-topic replies that derail.
4. **Mute/ban** only for repeated rule-breaking.

---

## Example Installs (ready to paste)

* **A (Deflect):** *“Appreciate the view. I posted this because it names a direction and a standard. Back to the clip’s point: ‘Don’t push a Canadian too far.’”*
* **B (Reframe):** *“Words are tools of action—constitutions and budgets are words. This clip sets the bar for what we should do next.”*
* **C (Humor):** *“Banning rhetoric would make Parliament blissfully quiet. Sadly, budgets still start as sentences.”*
* **D (Guardrail):** *“House rule: critique ideas; skip the sneers. Thread is about [topic]; off-topic repeats may be removed.”*
* **E (Evidence):** *“Concrete step since these remarks: [link]. Let’s discuss outcomes, not vibes.”*

## Metrics (lightweight)

* Replies per incident (target ≤ 1)
* Hide/remove count (track trends)
* Ratio of on-topic comments post-reply
* Save/Share rate of the original post (signal retention)
