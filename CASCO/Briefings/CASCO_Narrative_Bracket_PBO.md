# CASCO Narrative Bracket — Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) Report

**Scenario:**
A recent PBO report is being cited as proof of imminent fiscal collapse. Media and commentators highlight words like “unsustainable,” “alarming,” and “stupefying,” while leaving aside the context and caveats. In online debate, this gets escalated into an apocalyptic narrative (“reckless,” “end‑of‑world,” “slam dunk of failure”).

**Purpose:**
Provide a structured semantic bracket to track how the same report is narrated across different rhetorical intensities. This helps moderators, participants, and analysts:

* Distinguish between evidence and spin
* Identify where the conversation has drifted into exaggeration
* Anchor responses in the safe middle zones of factual interpretation

---

## Bracket Levels

### 1. **Baseline (Source Narrative)**

* **Who:** PBO itself
* **Form:** Technical, scenario‑based, cautious
* **Examples:**

  * “Deficits are projected to be higher than forecast under current assumptions.”
  * “There are fiscal risks if growth underperforms or interest rates remain elevated.”
  * “Transparency in reporting should be improved.”
* **Risk:** Misread as deterministic prediction rather than conditional analysis.

### 2. **Moderate Concern (Prudent Amplification)**

* **Who:** Responsible media, policy analysts, centrist commentators
* **Form:** Emphasis on seriousness, but with nuance
* **Examples:**

  * “The PBO warns that Canada’s fiscal path could become unsustainable without adjustments.”
  * “Government spending commitments are testing the limits of fiscal room.”
* **Risk:** Still reflects underlying uncertainty; can tip into alarm if context is lost.

### 3. **Alarmist Narrative (Escalated Framing)**

* **Who:** Opposition figures, partisan media, social amplifiers
* **Form:** Adjectives lifted, caveats stripped
* **Examples:**

  * “The PBO is slamming the budget as reckless and unsustainable.”
  * “This is proof that the government is driving Canada off a cliff.”
* **Risk:** Frames conditional warning as inevitable collapse; positions PBO as adversary rather than neutral assessor.

### 4. **Apocalyptic Spin (Weaponized Rhetoric)**

* **Who:** Trolls, agitators, bad‑faith actors
* **Form:** Doom framing, emotional triggers, certainty of catastrophe
* **Examples:**

  * “End of the world for Canada’s economy.”
  * “This proves the government has bankrupted us.”
  * “No debate left — only disaster.”
* **Risk:** Collapses debate into fear loop; eliminates policy nuance.

---

## Counter‑Frame

* **Anchor:** “The PBO provides scenarios, not prophecies. Their role is to map risks under certain assumptions so Parliament can make informed choices.”
* **Technique:**

  * Point back to the specific PBO document, date, and assumptions.
  * Highlight caveats and uncertainty ranges.
  * Acknowledge seriousness without overstating.
  * Shift discussion from *apocalypse* to *policy remedies*.

---

## Safe Claim Zones

* “The PBO is flagging risks that require policy attention.”
* “Fiscal sustainability depends on choices over the next decade, not just this year.”
* “Reports like this are part of normal parliamentary oversight, not proof of collapse.”

**Attestation:**
This bracket tracks narrative drift from cautious analysis → prudent concern → alarmist spin → apocalyptic doom. It is not about silencing critique, but about clarifying where a conversation stands and re‑centering on evidence.
