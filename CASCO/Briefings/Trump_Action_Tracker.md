### Summary

**TrumpActionTracker.info** is a transparent, volunteer-run initiative cataloguing ‚Äúauthoritarian-style actions‚Äù attributed to the U.S. administration since January 2025. Built by **Prof. Christina Pagel**, a UK-based academic known for data-driven public-interest research, the tracker provides a structured, searchable record organized into five analytical domains.

---

### 1. Governance & Intent

* **Independence:** Academic-led, not affiliated with PACs or media.
* **Transparency:** Public dataset, CSV export available, documented curation process.
* **Purpose:** To support civic situational awareness and historical recordkeeping, not statistical precision.

**Verdict:** Credible, transparent, methodologically published ‚Äî suitable for analytical use within CASCO‚Äôs civic integrity framework.

---

### 2. What‚Äôs Tracked

**Domains (5):**

1. Undermining Democracy
2. Suppressing Dissent
3. Civil Rights & Corruption
4. Science & Academia
5. Foreign Policy

Each domain includes specific behavioral definitions, allowing structured categorization of incidents (e.g., ‚Äúdelegitimizing oversight,‚Äù ‚Äúrestricting access to public information‚Äù). Counts are approximate and manually curated.

---

### 3. Data Methodology

* **Sources:** Public reporting and verifiable documentation.
* **Process:** Manually curated, volunteer-reviewed; flagged corrections are accepted.
* **Transparency:** Provides filters by domain and actor; CSV accessible for audit.

**Note:** This is a **curated dataset**, not an automated crawler. Interpret patterns directionally.

---

### 4. Strengths

‚úÖ Transparent authorship and classification framework
‚úÖ Open data (verifiable CSV and linked sources)
‚úÖ Interoperability with other trackers (Just Security, Project 2025, etc.)
‚úÖ Recognized by reputable third-party civic sources (e.g., *beSpacific* legal data blog)

---

### 5. Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è Normative bias: Framed explicitly around ‚Äúauthoritarian-style‚Äù actions
‚ö†Ô∏è Manual curation: Possible overlap and selection bias
‚ö†Ô∏è Data friction: CSV occasionally gated behind CDN/Substack links

**Interpretation guidance:** Use for trend and narrative mapping, not numerical claims.

---

### 6. CASCO Integration Recommendations

üîπ **Tile Framework:** Build CASCO ‚ÄúAuthoritarian Action‚Äù briefs referencing the tracker‚Äôs domains.
üîπ **Weekly Digest:** Pull deltas by domain and cross-link corroborating trackers.
üîπ **Semantic Radar:** Use the five-domain schema to map behavioral shifts across governance, civic rights, and disinformation vectors.

---

### 7. Improvement Suggestions for the Tracker

* Add **confidence/severity scores** per entry.
* Publish **change logs** and deduplication notes.
* Stabilize CSV endpoints for long-term archival integration.

---

### Canon Verdict

‚úÖ **Green-light for adoption.**
The tracker qualifies as a reliable **civic dataset** under CASCO protocol: transparent, well-scoped, and normatively clear.
Use as a **qualitative trend monitor** and **narrative alignment tool**, paired with corroborative data before citation in attestations or public messaging.
