# Ecosystem Overview: Canada’s Assault-Style Firearms Compensation Program (2025)

**Context note.** This briefing expands the earlier *Cape Breton Gun Buyback* CASCO tile to a national scope. It maps the policy lineage, actors, narratives, risks, and verifiable evidence streams around Canada’s compensation program for prohibited assault‑style firearms.

---

## 1) Executive summary (what’s true at a glance)

* **Intent:** Replace/disable specific prohibited firearm models via a **mandatory compensation** pathway (a.k.a. “buyback”), with parallel **deactivation**/grandfathering mechanisms defined by regulation.
* **Status (2025):** Program architecture exists at the federal level (Public Safety Canada / RCMP – Canadian Firearms Program). Provincial/municipal implementation varies; budget envelopes and vendor frameworks have been iterated since 2020.
* **Signal:** The national conversation is **plural** (public safety, rights, rural identity, trust in government capacity, cost control). “For/against” frames hide a more nuanced operational reality.
* **What the data can show:** Model lists, compensation tables, budget appropriations, procurement frameworks, and seizure/turn‑in counts are measurable; causal claims about crime reduction require multi‑year mixed‑method evaluation.

---

## 2) Policy lineage (attestable trail)

**Anchor events**

1. **May 2020 OIC prohibition**: Immediate prohibition of ~1,500 models/variants following Nova Scotia mass shooting; two‑year amnesty initiated (extended thereafter).
2. **Bill C‑21 (2021–2024 cycles)**: Amendments to the Firearms Act and Criminal Code; evolving definitions and exemptions; municipal handgun restrictions debate; advisory panels.
3. **Compensation program design (2020–2025):** Draft compensation tables, third‑party logistics planning (transport, storage, destruction), and RCMP registry/verification protocols iterated; vendor RFPs published and revised.

**Proof links (inserted for attestation)**

* Canada Gazette notices for 2020 OIC and amnesty extensions.
* Public Safety Canada backgrounders on the buyback/compensation framework.
* RCMP Canadian Firearms Program: model lists, technical bulletins.
* Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) cost analyses (where available), Treasury Board submissions.
* House/Senate committee evidence (SECU, SECD): ministerial/RCMP testimony.

> **CASCO note:** Each claim in this section can be footnoted to primary documents; use the Attestation Kit below to bind sources to sentences.

## 3) Program architecture (how it works when it works)

**Core components**

* **Eligibility:** Prohibited models/variants listed by regulation; verification via serial/model attributes in CFP.
* **Pathways:**

  * **Compensation (turn‑in):** Owner transfers custody to authorized program vendor/RCMP; compensated per schedule.
  * **Deactivation:** Permanent rendering inoperable by certified gunsmith to program spec; inspection + certification.
  * **Law‑enforcement/other exemptions:** Museums, forensic labs, Indigenous cultural/hunting contexts where applicable by permit/exemption.
* **Money flow:** Treasury Board‑approved envelope → PSPC vendor contracts → payments to owners via designated processor; audit trail required.
* **Safeguards:** Chain‑of‑custody logging, evidence photography, transport standards, destruction certification, audit sampling.

**Operational frictions (seen repeatedly)**

* Model identity edge‑cases; legacy/modified firearms; incomplete registry records.
* Rural access and logistics (distance to collection points, timing windows).
* Vendor capacity (surges) and storage/destruction throughput.
* Communication gaps (who is eligible, how to book, what deactivation means).

---

## 4) Stakeholder map (who moves the narrative)

* **Federal:** Public Safety Canada, RCMP–CFP, PSPC (procurement), Treasury Board (funding), PBO (oversight).
* **Provinces/Municipal:** Policing partners, collection sites, storage/destruction contractors.
* **Civil society:**

  * **Advocacy for stricter controls** (e.g., PolySeSouvient, doctors/nurses associations, urban mayors coalitions).
  * **Firearms rights/industry** (e.g., national/provincial sport‑shooting orgs, retailers, CCFR/others).
* **Media:** National broadcasters, local outlets (rural/urban split), specialty media.
* **Academia/think tanks:** Criminology, public health, policy evaluation shops.

**Power dynamics**

* Policymakers and policing orgs control **program rules & records**; advocacy groups shape **salience**; local media and municipal voices amplify **implementation frictions**.

## 5) Discourse analysis (frames you will meet)

**A. Public‑safety frame**

* *Claim:* Reduces access to high‑lethality platforms; aligns with international norms.
* *Watch‑for:* Over‑promising near‑term crime reductions; need to separate **mass‑casualty risk** from **street‑crime trends**.

**B. Rights/identity frame**

* *Claim:* Collective punishment; rural/Indigenous/collector identities de‑legitimized.
* *Watch‑for:* Slippage between **prohibited models** and **all long guns**; rhetoric that flattens distinctions.

**C. Competence/cost frame**

* *Claim:* Program complexity and waste; dollars per firearm too high; crowd‑out of other safety investments.
* *Watch‑for:* Baseline misunderstandings about logistics, destruction, and audit requirements.

**D. Trust & contamination frame**

* *Claim:* Data handling fears; misuse of owner records; fear of further prohibitions.
* *Watch‑for:* Conflation of **program enrolment** with **new registries**; rumor cascades.

> **CASCO move:** Keep debates parallel. Acknowledge *identity* concerns while still adjudicating *facts* (eligibility, costs, counts) with receipts.

---

## 6) Comparative lens (what other systems teach)

* **Australia 1996–97:** High compliance when rules were clear, collection convenient, and communications localized; evaluation shows effects strongest in mass‑shooting prevention rather than ordinary crime.
* **New Zealand 2019–22:** Multiple rounds, evolving exemptions, strong lessons in logistics/vendor management and communications in rural communities.
* **Prior Canadian amnesties:** Demonstrate that **clarity + convenience** are the drivers of uptake; ambiguity depresses compliance more than ideology does.

## 7) Risks & mitigations (practical)

| Risk               | Why it happens                                  | Mitigation that works                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low participation  | Confusion; travel burden; suspicion of data use | Mobile/doorstep collection, third‑party community partners, clear data minimization notices |
| Cost blow‑outs     | Transport/storage/destruction under‑scoped      | Fixed‑fee vendor bands; throughput KPIs; destruction SLAs with photo‑evidence               |
| Narrative spiral   | One bad clip = weeks of distrust                | Rapid‑response comms kit; attested FAQ; local spokespersons                                 |
| Edge‑case disputes | Model/variant ambiguity                         | Independent technical adjudication panel; publish determinations                            |

## 8) Metrics that actually measure

* **Inputs:** $ commited / $ obligated / $ disbursed (monthly)
* **Throughput:** firearms verified → collected → destroyed (counts by model family)
* **Coverage:** owners contacted vs. enrolled; rural/urban distribution; travel time
* **Quality:** % collections with clean chain‑of‑custody; audit exceptions; appeal outcomes
* **Outcomes (longer‑horizon):** changes in recovery of prohibited models in crime guns; mass‑casualty risk indicators (rare‑event metrics)
