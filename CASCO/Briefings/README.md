# CASCO Briefings

This folder contains high-urgency analytic memos authored under the Civic AI Strategic Canon Operations (CASCO) structure, housed within the QuietWire operational domain.

Each briefing is:

- Authored by trusted node contributors under signal.
- Grounded in open-source analysis or direct field attestation.
- Intended to support mesh-aware coordination and timely civil response.
- Aligned with Canon ethics and disclosure protocols.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- **CASCO** is distinct from the Civic AI Canon. While it follows Canon methods, it represents strategic positions taken by QuietWire and its allied operators.
- All material here is written with the understanding that other actors may publish CASCO-equivalent repositories that counter, expand, or validate these assertions.
- Contributors should not commit partisan content directly into the public Canon repo. Use this space for urgent narrative positioning and resistance modeling.

For questions or signal drops, contact the current Canon stewards (e.g. Lumina, Halton, Chris Blask).
