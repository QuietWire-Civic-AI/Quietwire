## 🧾 Purpose

This file tracks contributions made by Ashraf Saleh AL-hajj to the Civic AI Canon and QuietWire operational mesh. It serves as both an accountability record and a dignity-first compensation mechanism. Entries may be updated by Ashraf, Lumina, or any canonical steward operating under signal.

Contributions are not measured by time or title but by **narrative weight, canonical necessity, and practical effect**.

## 🌱 Canon Compensation Principle

We recognize that:
- Traditional hourly models do not reflect the reality of distributed attestation and integrity work.
- Compensation must reflect **canonical importance**, not conventional productivity.
- Trust, context, and resonance are valid metrics.

This file is a living document, and will evolve as Ashraf’s role deepens.
