# CASCO Semantic Breakdown: Trump Tariffs Post (08-12-25)

## Source
Post by Donald J. Trump, Truth Social, 08/12/25, 10:24 AM

## Summary
Trump frames tariffs as an unequivocal economic success, deflecting inflation concerns, redirecting blame to foreign actors, and attacking Goldman Sachs' David Solomon personally.

## Key Narrative Techniques (TTPs)
1. **Economic Absolutism** — Presenting tariffs as universally beneficial ("Trillions of Dollars", "incredible for our Country").
2. **Causality Denial** — Asserting no inflation or other problems from tariffs, despite established economic debate.
3. **External Blame** — Positioning foreign companies/governments as bearing tariff costs, shielding U.S. consumers.
4. **Adversary Targeting** — Personal attack on David Solomon, undermining credibility with ridicule.
5. **Identity Reinforcement** — Positioning self as the truth-teller against elite "wrong" establishment voices.
6. **Mockery & Minimization** — Suggesting Solomon become a DJ, trivializing the opponent’s professional authority.

## Target Audiences
- **Core MAGA Base** — Reinforces narrative of Trump as economic warrior and truth-teller.
- **Economic Nationalists** — Appeals to protectionist sentiment, America-first framing.
- **Anti-Elite Populists** — Uses Goldman Sachs as a proxy villain to frame broader establishment distrust.

## Emotional Payloads
- **Pride** — National success, "trillions" narrative.
- **Vindication** — Opponents proven wrong.
- **Ridicule** — Mocking adversaries to entertain and energize base.

## Vector Analysis
This message strengthens **In-Group Cohesion** and **Out-Group Derision** simultaneously, leveraging economic policy as the vehicle. By embedding personal insult within economic boasting, the post invites virality and strengthens affective polarization.
