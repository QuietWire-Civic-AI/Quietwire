# Authoritarian Escalation Ladder – D.C. Overlay
**Created:** 2025-08-11 01:24 UTC

## Steps & Windows
1. **Define the Problem in Moral Absolutes (Weeks −2 to 0)**
   - Marker: decay rhetoric, binaries, “take back the capital”.  
2. **Claim Emergency Authority (Day 0–7)**
   - Marker: “immediately”, federal scope, beauty/safety justification.  
3. **Visible Demonstration of Force (Day 1–30)**
   - Marker: sweeps with media, barricades, lighting.  
4. **Normalize Through Repetition (Month 1–6)**
   - Marker: second sweep + named program.  
5. **Expand Jurisdiction & Targets (Month 3–12)**
   - Marker: methods applied to new groups/areas.  
6. **Rewrite Civic Memory (Year 1+)**
   - Marker: official imagery erases prior state.

## Forecast Clock (from first kinetic sweep)
- **+0–30 days:** staged cleanups; arrest spikes among unhoused.  
- **+31–60 days:** repeat sweeps; “crime down” narratives.  
- **+61–180 days:** export model to other cities; broaden targets.
