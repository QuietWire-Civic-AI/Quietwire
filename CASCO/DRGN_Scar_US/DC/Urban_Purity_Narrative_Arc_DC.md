# Urban Purity Narrative Arc (D.C. Context)
**Created:** 2025-08-11 01:24 UTC

## Purpose
Model how “beautification” rhetoric is used as a pretext for power consolidation, with D.C. as the current case.

## Stages
1. **Pretext Seeding** — Selective disorder imagery; nostalgia frames (“take it back”).  
2. **Justified Enforcement** — Urgent timelines; binary casting (clean/lawful vs. dirty/criminal).  
3. **Normalization & Expansion** — Repeated sweeps; jurisdiction creep.  
4. **Civic Memory Rewrite** — “It has always been like this” narratives; curated official imagery.

## Current Placement
- Late **Stage 1** / early **Stage 2** (language of immediacy; binaries; precedent claims).

## Indicators to Watch
- Official photo ops of removals, fences/barricades, and follow‑on “program branding” names.
