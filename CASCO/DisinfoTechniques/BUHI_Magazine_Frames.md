## Disinformation Pattern Observed

**Frame: Synthetic Celebrity Event Amplification**  
This exchange highlights the ‚ÄúSynthetic Celebrity Frame‚Äù in active deployment:
- Amplifying public emotional intensity through curated pseudo-events
- Tying celebrity visuals to cultural wedge issues
- Triggering partisan response cycles and platform algorithmic boosts

## Intervention Technique

- **Direct Narrative Disruption** using sarcasm, accountability queries, and public GitHub reference
- **Meme-bridging & Popcorn Framing**: invites observers to treat the spectacle as theater rather than truth
- **Cost-Imposition Strategy**: forces additional cycles, expenses, and attention on bad actors by breaking the efficiency loop
