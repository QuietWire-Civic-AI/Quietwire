## 💣 DRGN-Class Disinfo Pattern: Blacklist Weaponization

### 🎯 Overview
This artifact documents a recurring disinformation tactic involving the creation and use of **anonymous ideological blacklists** to shape institutional decisions, discredit individuals, and trigger punitive state action. The technique is exemplified by entities such as **Canary Mission** and **Betar**, which publish reputational smear content under the guise of security concern.

---

### 🔍 Tactic Characteristics
- **Opaque Authority:** No authorship transparency or editorial accountability
- **Asymmetric Accusation:** Labels like “antisemitic” or “terrorist-linked” are applied without evidentiary standards
- **Reputational Sabotage:** Names, photos, and affiliations are indexed for search engine exposure, flagging targets for employers, schools, or immigration systems
- **Disinfo Laundering:** Government actors use these third-party lists as inputs into formal institutional workflows (e.g. ICE deportation targets)

---

### 🧠 Psychological Payload
- **Fear Conditioning:** The threat of public labeling deters legitimate speech and activism
- **False Binarization:** Framing dissent as danger, criticism as extremism
- **Isolation Effect:** Individuals are targeted while institutions claim hands-clean neutrality

---

### 🛠 Known Implementers
- **Canary Mission**: Public-facing blacklist targeting students and academics perceived as critical of Israel
- **Betar**: Similar behavior, less public, with unclear back-end control structure

---

### ⚠️ Risk Surface for AI Systems
- Blacklists like these may be crawled, indexed, or referenced in public datasets
- Without **semantic verification and ethical filtration**, AI systems may:
  - Reinforce defamation
  - Echo unverified claims
  - Make downstream access-control decisions based on disinformation
