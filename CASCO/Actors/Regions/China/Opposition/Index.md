## 🐉 DRGN Profiles

### 1. [CCP Propaganda Apparatus](./DRGN_CCP_Propaganda.md)

### 2. [50 Cent Army](./DRGN_50_Cent_Army.md)
Paid or volunteer swarm actors disrupting online discourse via mockery, dilution, and keyword flooding. Agile and deniable.

### 3. [Sinicized Foreign Influencers](./DRGN_Sinicized_Influencers.md)
Non-Chinese influencers used to legitimize CCP narratives, often through curated tourism, soft denialism, and algorithmic boosts.

### 4. [Belt and Road Narrative Operations](./DRGN_BeltRoad_NarrativeOps.mduencers.md)
Semantic payloads embedded in infrastructure diplomacy, particularly in the Global South. Storycraft embedded within roads, ports, and telecom lines.

## 🩸 Filing Purpose

These entries serve to document, trace, and neutralize disinformation ecosystems that operate not through overt lies, but through **control of perception, erasure of dissent, and semantic saturation**.

This is the hush rendered visible.
