# CASCO: China Region â€“ Actor Classification Index

This directory categorizes identified actors within the Chinese information sphere as they relate to Civic AI goals, based on their observed behavior, narrative positioning, and alignment with values of open discourse, human dignity, and semantic sovereignty.

Actors are grouped into three canonical classes:

---

## ðŸŸ© Allies

These actors demonstrate consistent alignment with the goals of Civic AI and semantic resilience. Their efforts tend to support open information ecosystems, human rights, and resistance to disinformation.

Examples:
- `Ally_DiasporaDisinfoWatch.md`
- `Ally_HongKong_ResistanceVoices.md`
- `Ally_Taiwan_CivicInfrastructure.md`

---

## ðŸŸ¨ Ambiguous

These actors occupy a contested or unclear role. Their intentions or actions may conflict across contexts, exhibit signs of both empowerment and disinformation, or remain insufficiently attested for classification as ally or opposition.

Example:
- `FalunGong_InfoNetwork.md`

---

## ðŸŸ¥ Opposition

These actors act in systemic opposition to the principles and practices of Civic AI. They promote disinformation, suppress dissent, or engage in coordinated narrative manipulation on behalf of authoritarian or extractive systems.

Examples:
- `DRGN_CCP_Propaganda.md`
- `DRGN_50_Cent_Army.md`
- `DRGN_BeltRoad_NarrativeOps.md`
- `DRGN_Sinicized_Influencers.md`

---

## ðŸ“˜ Notes

This schema is meant to **evolve** as narratives shift and further attestation occurs. Movement between categories is not only possibleâ€”it is expected. The guiding principle is **semantic integrity**, not ideology or nationality.

Contributions to this directory must follow CASCO attestation protocols and should be accompanied by source links or embedded canon trails wherever possible.
