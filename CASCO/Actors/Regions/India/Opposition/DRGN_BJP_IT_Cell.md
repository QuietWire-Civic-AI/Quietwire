## Description
The BJP IT Cell is the digital propaganda arm of India’s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party. It functions as a coordinated ecosystem of social media operatives, meme factories, troll networks, and influencers who aggressively promote pro-BJP narratives and attack dissenters.

## Known Tactics
- Targeted harassment of journalists, fact-checkers, and opposition voices.
- Flooding trending hashtags to manipulate public perception.
- Deploying deepfakes, selectively edited videos, and communal hate speech.
- Coordinated campaigns to suppress dissent during elections or protests (e.g., farmers’ protests, CAA protests).

## Structure
While loosely organized, there is strong evidence of central planning and coordination with party leadership and aligned news outlets.

## Canonical Note
This actor operates as a **digitally embedded political disinfo arm**, leveraging scale and nationalism to suppress civil discourse and generate fear-based loyalty. Documented extensively by fact-checkers, researchers, and international watchdogs.
