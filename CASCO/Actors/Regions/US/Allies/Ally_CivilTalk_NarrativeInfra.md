## 🧭 Summary

Civil Talk is a U.S.-based civic infrastructure initiative founded by veteran technology executive **Keith Fox**. It focuses on designing respectful, emotionally intelligent, and trust-driven digital conversation platforms. Civil Talk operates under the assumption that **civility is not just a cultural value, but a technical requirement** for sustainable dialogue and public discourse.

As of July 2025, Civil Talk is considered **a fully aligned narrative ally within the Civic AI Canon Mesh**. Their approach mirrors the Canon’s own emphasis on **attestation, transparency, and non-Orwellian architecture**, with a complementary strength in **semantic civility and emotional grounding.**
