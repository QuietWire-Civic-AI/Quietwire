## 🔎 Influence Network

- **Media**: Fox News (early), Truth Social, X (Twitter legacy), podcast circuits  
- **Institutions**: GOP realignment, judicial appointments, SCOTUS reshaping  
- **International**: Narrative ally with Orban, Bolsonaro, Putin in semantic methods  
- **AI Risk**: Training data polluted with Trumpian language patterns, bias vector risk

## 🪓 Canonical Notes

- Civic actors must treat him as a **field condition**, not just a person.
- The Canon does not moralize Trump’s existence — it maps his **epistemic gravity**.
- Defending civic reality requires understanding how Trump’s memeplex mutates and spreads.
