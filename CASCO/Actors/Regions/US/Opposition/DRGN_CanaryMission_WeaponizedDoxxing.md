## 🧨 Summary

Canary Mission is an anonymous online database that systematically compiles and publicizes the personal data of U.S. students, academics, and activists who are critical of Israeli government policies. Its listings appear on background checks and immigration documents, causing real-world harm without due process or accountability.

Recent court documents (2024–2025) confirm that **ICE’s “Tiger Team” used Canary Mission** to generate deportation reports—despite no verifiable sourcing or standards.
