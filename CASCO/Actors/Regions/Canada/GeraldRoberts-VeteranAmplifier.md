---

## Semantic Posture

### 1. **Persona Construction**

* Veteran identity invoked to claim credibility and moral authority.
* Label “Opinion Giver” establishes himself as outsider-truth teller, not accountable to institutions.

### 2. **Vector of Engagement**

* Reposts and amplifies partisan content (e.g., Mark Carney as “caught lying AGAIN!”).
* Uses **spectacle rhetoric**: all-caps, exclamation points, heightened emotional tone.
* Rarely produces original narratives → instead **amplifies seeded talking points**.

### 3. **Mechanism of Appeal**

* **Veteran status** frames him as patriotic authority.
* **Grievance register**: themes of betrayal, elite corruption, wage suppression, foreign workers.
* Creates **in-group solidarity** by translating abstract claims into plain-felt anger.

### 4. **Semantic Function**

* Archetype: **Trusted Everyman Veteran**.
* Acts as **bridge amplifier**: lending authenticity to elite-seeded propaganda by rephrasing it in the voice of a loyal soldier and ordinary Canadian.
* Not persuasion-focused → designed to harden identity inside the circle.

### 5. **Dragon Features**

* **Spectacle dependency:** thrives on boldness and outrage rather than evidence.
* **Delegitimization vector:** positions central institutions (Bank of Canada, leadership figures) as liars and traitors.
* **Projection device:** casts himself as truth-teller vs. corrupt elites.

## Canon Note

Gerald Roberts is not an originator but an **amplifier node**, functioning as a local trust vector. His military identity enables him to repackage elite-propagated narratives as authentic, grassroots truths. In the CASCO taxonomy, he is a **spectacle carrier** — dependent on borrowed content but effective in projecting betrayal frames into everyday discourse.
