## Event Summary

In September 2025, Politico reported that the Pentagon’s newly drafted **National Defense Strategy**, overseen by “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth, shifts emphasis away from China and Russia as pacing threats. Instead, it prioritizes:

* Domestic deployments of U.S. troops.
* Militarized border zones.
* Naval and air assets redirected to hemispheric policing (e.g., Caribbean counter-narcotics).

This marks a dramatic departure from two decades of bipartisan consensus that China’s rise required sustained forward U.S. presence in Asia.

## Semantic Breakdown

### 1. External Threat Recast as Internal Enemy

* National defense is reframed as **control of domestic populations**.
* Blurs boundaries between foreign war and internal policing.
* A hallmark of authoritarian narrative: *the enemy is at home.*

### 2. Fraudulent Hawks

* GOP “China hawks” used confrontation rhetoric as cover for domestic ambitions.
* Their hawkishness was **never strategic** but performative — a posture to accumulate political capital.

### 3. Militarization of Authority

* Troops in U.S. cities and militarized borders transform defense into coercive governance.
* Confirms Samuel Huntington’s warning (1957): politicizing the military for domestic disputes erodes the republic.

### 4. Narrative Payoff

* Abandoning global commitments is spun as “America First.”
* True meaning: **security is measured by how much force can be projected inward.**
* China and Russia remain rhetorical foils, but operational focus is domestic consolidation.

## Canon Pattern Recognition

* **Spectacle of Betrayal:** Hawks denounced Democrats as weak on China, but pivot inward once in power.
* **Authority through Internal War:** Security discourse laundered into domestic enforcement.
* **Isolationism in Hawk’s Clothing:** Rhetoric of global confrontation disguises intent of internal domination.
* **Dragon Vector:** `DRGN-ChinaHawk-Fraud` — *strategic inversion*, where external threat posturing becomes internal authoritarian consolidation.

## CASCO Classification

## Canon Note

The so-called “China hawks” were never committed to generational confrontation with Beijing. Their hawkishness was always a costume — a means of staging fear to build domestic authority. Their final evolution reveals the true play: *not deterrence abroad, but domination at home.*
