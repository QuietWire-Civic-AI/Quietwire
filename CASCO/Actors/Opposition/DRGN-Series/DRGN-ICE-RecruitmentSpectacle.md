**CASCO Path:**
`CASCO/Actors/Opposition/DRGN-Series/DRGN-ICE-RecruitmentSpectacle.md`

---

## Context

* **Artifact:** LinkedIn advertisement for ICE recruitment.
* **Imagery:** Adaptation of James Montgomery Flagg’s 1917 *Uncle Sam Wants You* wartime poster.
* **Offer:** “Join ICE Today – \$50,000 Signing Bonus,” framed as a job-market opportunity with salaries, health insurance, and retirement.

## Semantic Breakdown

### 1. Symbolic Appropriation

* Recasts iconic wartime imagery into a civilian recruitment drive.
* Transfers meaning from *civic duty in wartime* → *immigration enforcement as combat mission*.

### 2. Militarization of Civic Administration

* Immigration enforcement reframed as paramilitary service.
* Bureaucratic governance depicted as frontline defense of the homeland.
* Part of a broader vector blurring lines between military and civil institutions.

### 3. Economic Incentive as Ideological Mask

* Patriotism commodified: \$50,000 bonus reframes service as labor-for-hire.
* Obedience monetized, not valorized.
* Message: loyalty is a transaction, not a duty.

### 4. Fascist Resonance

* Fascist aesthetics frequently appropriate national symbols to normalize authoritarian roles.
* Uncle Sam imagery signals national destiny, but here conscripts citizens into enforcement.
* Civic obligation collapsed into state force as employment.

### 5. Platform Shock

* LinkedIn context amplifies semiotic dissonance: professional networking turned into spectacle stage.
* Ad functions as normalization device: state coercion presented as just another career choice.
