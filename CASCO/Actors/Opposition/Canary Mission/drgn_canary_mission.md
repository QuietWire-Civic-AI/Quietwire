## 🐉 DRGN Node Profile: Canary Mission

### 🔖 Classification
- **Entity Type:** Anonymous Reputational Blacklist
- **DRGN Class:** Narrative Weaponization
- **Status:** Active
- **Visibility:** High (SEO-optimized public platform)

---

### 🕸 Behavioral Profile
- **Doxxing:** Publishes names, photos, affiliations of individuals (primarily students and academics)
- **Labeling:** Accuses targets of antisemitism, extremism, or terrorist affiliation with no transparent standards
- **Obfuscation:** Maintains anonymity of operators; no public accountability for content or process
- **Amplification Risk:** Indexed by major search engines, surfaces in background checks and institutional vetting systems
- **Ideological Vector:** Pro-Israel positioning with surveillance-like focus on critics of Israeli policy

---

### 🧨 Weaponization Path
1. **Target Identification:** Scrapes social media, petitions, public speeches
2. **Narrative Framing:** Ascribes dangerous ideologies to otherwise protected expression
3. **Reputation Damage:** Ensures digital permanence of accusations
4. **State Integration:** Profiles used by U.S. agencies (ICE, State Dept) to justify investigations or detentions
