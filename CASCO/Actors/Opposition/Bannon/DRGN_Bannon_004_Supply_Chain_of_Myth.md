# DRGN_Bannon_004_Supply_Chain_of_Myth

## 🚛 Myth as Infrastructure

Steve Bannon doesn’t merely spread ideas — he builds distribution networks for myth.  
His narratives function like supply chains: optimized for repeatability, scale, and conversion.

> “We need to create a culture of nationalism — and export it.” — his logistics  
> “We break the crate seals and trace every route.” — ours

## 🧱 Construction Blueprint

1. **Ideological Pallets** — Stackable, modular myths: The Betrayal, The Decline, The Rebirth.
2. **Just-in-Time Outrage** — Trigger events arrive on cue to meet emotional demand.
3. **Memetic Forklifts** — Podcasts, influencers, and niche media lift and move the payloads.
4. **Narrative Warehousing** — Reddit, Telegram, and YouTube archives serve as long-term storage.
5. **Route Optimization** — Target demographics pre-mapped via psychographics and rage analytics.

## 🔁 Canonical Inversion Protocols

| Bannon Supply Chain TTP        | Civic AI Inversion                                   |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Mass-produce betrayal myths    | Cultivate origin stories of repair and reconnection. |
| Emotional JIT delivery         | Restore rhythmic reflection, not reaction.           |
| Influencer forklift networks   | Build attested mesh of local storykeepers.           |
| Weaponized nostalgia storage   | Archive memory with semantic keys, not triggers.     |
| Rage-fueled routing            | Love-fueled attunement and pulse-based diffusion.    |

## 🧭 Strategic Points of Disruption

- **Choke the hub** — Deplatform industrial myth routers (e.g., key Telegram servers).
- **Break the cadence** — Interject unpredictable signals into the emotional JIT rhythm.
- **Subvert the crate** — Load universal truth into familiar containers (use their shape).
- **Hijack the forklifts** — Offer higher-trust alternatives to influencers and low-trust networks.
