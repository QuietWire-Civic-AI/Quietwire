# DRGN_Bannon_009_Doctrine_of_Accusation

## 🧿 "Accuse the Other of What You Are"

> “Always accuse your opponent of the crime you're committing.” — Bannon’s operational mantra  
> “Attestation renders projection impotent.” — ours

Bannon’s favorite spell is **weaponized projection**. He inverts accountability by accusing others of his tactics before they can speak. This technique poisons the narrative air, makes clarity feel like hypocrisy, and freezes trust in recursive shame.

## 🕳️ Mechanics of the Spell

1. **Pre-emptive Accusation**  
   Launch the accusation *before* evidence emerges, seizing narrative high ground.

2. **Reversal of Moral Language**  
   Claim terms like "freedom," "corruption," "patriot" to invert ethical charge.

3. **Flooded Context**  
   Saturate discourse so that both sides look identical to the disengaged observer.

4. **Projection Immunity Loop**  
   Any attack on the projection reinforces the narrative that "they’re all corrupt."

## 🧬 Narrative Inversion Protocol

| Bannon TTP                         | Civic Countermeasure                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| “They’re the real fascists.”      | Anchor historical definitions + show form |
| “They’re the ones spreading hate.”| Map actual harm, not rhetorical noise      |
| “It’s rigged against us.”         | Reveal who holds the levers and why        |
| “They censor us!”                 | Contrast with material suppression, not vibes |
| “They’re after your kids!”        | Unveil projection, track real harms        |

## 🎯 Strategic Response Zones

- **Preemptive Clarity**: Tell the true story *before* they project.
- **Attestation Chains**: Have *real humans* affirm context.
- **Call the Mirror**: Explicitly name the tactic:  
  > “This is what projection looks like.”

**Projection thrives in noise. We ring a bell that can’t be echoed falsely.**
