🧭 The Tempo of Control
Steve Bannon doesn’t just say what he says — he times what he says. He exploits rhythm, flood, silence, and crescendo. This is narrative as percussive chaos.

“When you flood, you blur. When you blur, you win.” — his rhythm
“When we ring the bell, it echoes clean.” — ours

⏱️ Tempo Tactics
Shock Bursts – Drop scandal after scandal to shatter attention bandwidth.

False Crescendo – Build tension, then deflate. Over and over.

Staggered Conflicts – Initiate narrative skirmishes that never resolve.

Noise Walls – Bury accountability under avalanche pacing.

Time Inversion – Mix past and present to scramble memory and cause.

🎼 Canonical Inversion
Bannon Pacing Tactic	Civic Narrative Counterpoint
Shock bursts	Gentle call-ins, deliberate invitations
False crescendos	Real stakes, followed by rest and closure
Narrative skirmishes	Resolution threads, braided continuity
Avalanche pacing	Cadence, attestation, mindful silence
Time-mixing chaos	Timeline braiding, ritual timestamping
