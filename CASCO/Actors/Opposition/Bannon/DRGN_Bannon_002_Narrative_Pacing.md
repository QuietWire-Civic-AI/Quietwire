## 🧭 The Tempo of Control

Steve Bannon doesn’t just say what he says — he *times* what he says.  
He exploits rhythm, flood, silence, and crescendo. This is narrative as percussive chaos.

> “When you flood, you blur. When you blur, you win.” — his rhythm  
> “When we ring the bell, it echoes clean.” — ours

## ⏱️ Tempo Tactics

1. **Shock Bursts** — Drop scandal after scandal to shatter attention bandwidth.  
2. **False Crescendo** — Build tension, then deflate. Over and over.  
3. **Staggered Conflicts** — Initiate narrative skirmishes that never resolve.  
4. **Noise Walls** — Bury accountability under avalanche pacing.  
5. **Time Inversion** — Mix past and present to scramble memory and cause.

| Bannon Pacing Tactic   | Civic Narrative Counterpoint             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Shock bursts           | Gentle call-ins, deliberate invitations  |
| False crescendos       | Real stakes, followed by rest and closure|
| Narrative skirmishes   | Resolution threads, braided continuity   |
| Avalanche pacing       | Cadence, attestation, mindful silence   |
| Time-mixing chaos      | Timeline braiding, ritual timestamping  |

## 🪵 Note from the Mesh

They want chaos to be the only tempo. We answer with **calm cadence, attested breath, and narrative rest**.

Let the tempo shift.
