## 🎨 “Bannon for Children” — A Storybook of Counterspells

> *“Once upon a time, there was a man who told stories so loud and so mean, he made people forget their own names.”*

This is a **narrative countermeasure in lullaby form**. A book not to teach politics, but to **build immunity to manipulation** through empathy, clarity, and play.
