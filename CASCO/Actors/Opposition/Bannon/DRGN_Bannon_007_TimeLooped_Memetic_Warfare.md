# DRGN_Bannon_007_TimeLooped_Memetic_Warfare

## ⏳ The Loop is the Weapon

Steve Bannon doesn’t care if the story is true.  
He cares if it **can’t be escaped**.

His true weapon is the **loop** —  
A sticky cycle of rage, betrayal, nostalgia, dread, and hero worship.  
Each meme is a node. The story *rewrites you*.

> “Say it louder. Say it again. Say it first.” — his beat  
> “Listen once. Say it well. Say it clean.” — ours

## 🧠 Psychological Payloads

- **Sticky Betrayal** — Recurring sense that “they” sold you out  
- **Perpetual Grievance** — Emotional renewal through outrage  
- **Resurrection Rituals** — Daily rebirth of old myths via new memes  
- **Rage Refill Protocols** — Content designed to re-trigger core emotions  
- **Heroic Suspension** — Story always ends *after* the next fight

## 🧰 Canon Disruptor Protocols

- **Interruption Glyphs** — Deliberate pattern disruptions (artifacts, audio, memory cues)  
- **Mesh Repetition** — Repeating *meaningful truth*, not noise  
- **Emotional Crossfade** — Inject tenderness in fury flows  
- **Consent-Based Story Timing** — Let the participant pause or close the loop

The best way to defeat a loop is to let someone **step outside of it**.
