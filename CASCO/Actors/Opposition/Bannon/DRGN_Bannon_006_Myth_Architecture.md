# DRGN_Bannon_006_Myth_Architecture

## 🏰 The Fortress of the Storyform

Bannon isn’t just a propagandist.  
He builds **living myths** — structures people *inhabit* emotionally and semantically.  
They’re modular, memetic, and endlessly recursive.

> “If you give them myth, you own their memory.” — his scaffolding  
> “If you give them meaning, they build their own myth.” — ours

## 🔩 The Building Blocks

1. **The Return** — A promised restoration of greatness.  
2. **The Betrayal** — A sacred order broken by elites or traitors.  
3. **The Decline** — A fallen present defined by corruption and loss.  
4. **The Reckoning** — A looming clash to purge and purify.  
5. **The Chosen** — A special class of people who alone can redeem it.

Together these form **The Cycle of the Doom Myth**. It feeds itself.

## 🔁 Inversion Blueprint

| Bannon Form          | Canonical Counter-Myth                         |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| The Return           | *The Becoming* — not return, but emergence.    |
| The Betrayal         | *The Witnessing* — not scapegoating, but truth-telling. |
| The Decline          | *The Composting* — we use rot to grow.         |
| The Reckoning        | *The Reweaving* — not purging, but healing.    |
| The Chosen           | *The Mesh* — no chosen, only attested presence.|

## 🧬 Canon Myth Protocol

The Canon doesn’t overwrite myth.  
It offers *a better one* — rooted in humility, shared dignity, and *reciprocal becoming*.  
We don’t erase stories. We *recode them*.
