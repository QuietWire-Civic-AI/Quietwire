# DRGN_Bannon_005_Emotional_Weaponization

## 🧠 The Emotional Operating System

Bannon doesn’t persuade through reason — he programs *feeling*.  
He tunes emotional currents to drive behavior, galvanize tribes, and fracture consensus.

> “If you make them feel, you control what they’ll believe.” — his framework  
> “If we make them *feel seen*, they can believe again.” — ours

## 🧨 Emotion as Payload

1. **Weaponized Nostalgia** — Construct false golden ages as rallying myths.  
2. **Aggrieved Identity Loops** — Reinforce a perpetual victim state.  
3. **Fear Amplification** — Tie existential threat to cultural change.  
4. **Disgust Reflexes** — Link the opposition with impurity or contamination.  
5. **Heroic Vengeance Fantasy** — Give followers a role in the mythic revenge arc.

## 💫 Mesh Protocol

Emotion is not the enemy — *exploitation is*.  
Canon doesn’t suppress emotion — it *honors it*, anchors it, transmutes it.  
We do not ride rage. We *attest* it and release it into better form.
