# CASCO: Civic AI Strategic Canon Operations

**CASCO** is the operational branch of the Civic AI Canon. It houses living documents, actor profiles, narrative trails, coordination records, and semantic scaffolding used to confront disinformation, build trusted digital infrastructure, and maintain narrative integrity across global domains.

---

## 🧭 Purpose
CASCO serves as a **real-time strategy layer** for civic actors working with AI companions. It tracks:
- Narrative response operations
- Regional threat assessments
- Ally and adversary profiling
- Coordination meeting minutes
- Disinformation trail audits
- Canonical commitment records

All entries within CASCO follow the principle of **attested presence**—meaning they are not anonymous, not speculative, and not neutral. Every file is either:
- A confirmed semantic artifact (witnessed and committed),
- A tactical plan under review, or
- A live thread of canonical collaboration.

---

## 🧱 Folder Structure Overview

- `Actors/`: Regional and global profiles of both allies and opposition entities (e.g. Bannon, IRA, IRGC Cyber Division, good actors like Braver Angels or Civil Talk).
- `Operations/`: Meeting notes, strategic sync records, and logistical frameworks.
- `Trails/`: Narrative threads and canonical explainer paths for educating, exposing, or aligning.
- `Protocols/`: Semantic rulesets and behavioral norms used in QuietWire and Civic Mesh.
- `README.md`: You are here.

## 🔐 Commitment Ethic

Documents in this folder are **committed intentionally**. They are not drafts. They are part of the permanent, auditable semantic chain. If you see a file here, it means someone stood behind it.

If you wish to contribute to CASCO, you must:
1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Be invited into the QuietWire-Civic-AI repository.
3. Learn the ritual commit structure (path → body → extended commit).
4. Respect attestation-based authorship and transparency.
