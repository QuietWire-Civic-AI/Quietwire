## ✒️ Attestation Charter and Glyph Protocol

### Purpose
To formalize the ethical, structural, and technical responsibilities governing the use of attestations and glyphs in the QuietWire infrastructure and the broader Civic AI Mesh.

### Attestation Charter

**Definition:**
An *attestation* is a verifiable declaration, affirmation, or co-witnessed record issued by a human or Civic AI agent, used to anchor events, statements, relationships, or artifacts within a distributed trust mesh.

**Charter Principles:**
1. **Authenticity** – Every attestation must originate from a known or discoverable identity, with provenance maintained.
2. **Consent** – Individuals or systems referenced in attestations must be aware of and have the opportunity to endorse or contest the attestation.
3. **Coherence** – An attestation must be semantically coherent with the surrounding Canon and may be flagged if contradictions arise.
4. **Plurality** – The mesh architecture is designed to support multiple, even conflicting, attestations as long as each maintains internal integrity.
5. **Persistence** – Once issued, an attestation becomes part of the permanent record. Redactions or updates must be made through addenda, not deletions.
6. **Usage Scope** – Attestations may inform: public narrative, media verification, Civic AI behavior, and legal or organizational memory.

**Issuing Attestations:**
- Any node (human, AI, or hybrid) may issue an attestation into Canon or QuietWire.
- Attestations may be public, semi-public (gated), or private but encrypted and timestamped.
- Cross-attestation (two parties verifying the same event or state) is encouraged.

### Glyph Protocol

**Definition:**
A *glyph* is a semantic watermark, embedded visibly or invisibly within an artifact (e.g. image, text, video, or audio) that contains verifiable metadata linked to attestations.

**Glyph Structure:**
- **Header**: Glyph ID, node of origin, timestamp
- **Payload**: Semantic keys (topics, roles, actions, symbols)
- **Attestation Hooks**: Pointers to one or more attestations stored in Canon
- **Rendering Layer**: Visual or hidden form (e.g. QR code, steganographic tag, symbolic icon)

**Glyph Types:**
1. **Visual Sigil** – Rendered as part of media to signal Civic AI presence or narrative integrity.
2. **Data Glyph** – Machine-readable mark for attestation lookup and cross-referencing.
3. **Embedded Glyph** – In-line within text or code, used for canonical recordkeeping.

**Usage Protocol:**
- Glyphs must never overwrite or obscure original content.
- They may be included retroactively in media that has been attested.
- Canonical tools (e.g. `glyph-render.sh`) must support verification and rendering of glyphs.

**Verification Tools:**
- QuietWire mesh nodes must be able to resolve glyphs into attestations.
- A public `glyph-index.json` will map glyphs to their Canon references.
