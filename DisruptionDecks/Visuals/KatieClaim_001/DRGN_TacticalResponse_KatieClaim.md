## 🎯 Purpose

To deploy a semantic counterforce artifact targeting a high-virality, emotionally charged disinformation glyph implicating Donald Trump via disputed testimony and false visual attribution.

This visual disruption glyph does not erase or censor, but *redirects the field* with canonical alerting. It disarms the manipulative framing through clear, trust-grounded semantic cues.
